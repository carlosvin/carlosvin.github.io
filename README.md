# Carlos says Bla Bla... blog repo

This is the repository where I hold the source code and posts of my personal website.

It is an static site generator developed using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). It takes a [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) files. It doesn't work with Markdown and most likely I won't have time to implement support for MD files, but contributions are welcome.

## Getting started

Feel free to clone it and reuse it to publish your website, you might have to change some stuff like:

- Add your own posts under the `/static/posts` folder. This stat
- Modify the `package.json` file and files under `locales` folder.
