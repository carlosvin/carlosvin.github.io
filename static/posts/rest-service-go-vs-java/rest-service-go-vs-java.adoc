Lately I've been working with two different technology stacks almost in parallel, in both cases we were using them to develop {rest} services.

During this time I've come up with some conclusions and opinions I'd like to share.

A disclaimer, few months ago, I had several years of experience with Java and 0 days of professional experience with Golang.

== Actual project examples

Few months ago I created https://covid-rest.appspot.com/docs[an API to extract and structure COVID-19 data,window=_blank] from https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide[ECDC website,window=_blank]. I developed it in {spring-rest}.

Few months later I had the luck of work on my first professional project in {go} and I decided to create a port of https://covid-rest.appspot.com/docs[the API to extract COVID-19 data,window=_blank] in {go}, just for learning and for fun. 

So, now we have two REST services, almost functionally identical, but developed in two different tech stacks.

NOTE: I actually created that https://covid-rest.appspot.com/docs[COVID-19 data REST API] to be the data source for the {covid19app}, a {pwa} built with {svelte}, but that's another topic.


== The Ecosystems

If you want to create a {rest} service just in plain Java you will have extra work to do, in Golang a little bit less. That's why we use framework, because they've already solved many common problems for us. 

For this comparison I am going to use {spring-rest} for {java} and {gin} for {go}, but in both languages there are a lot of production ready nice options.

== Routing

=== Go - Without framework
Go uses the concept of {http} multiplexer or router. You can specify routes using patterns and link those routes to handlers. The router will decide which handler has to execute the request based on the path received.

.router.go
[source,go]
----
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	router := http.NewServeMux()
	router.Handle("/redirect", http.RedirectHandler("https://carlosvin.github.io/", 307))
	router.HandleFunc("/hello", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte("Hello world!"))
	})
	log.Println("Listening...")
	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", router)
}
----

Source code is already quite simple, but there might more complex routing use cases.

=== Go - Gin Framework

Happily there are frameworks that help us to keep our base code simple, for example when we need to extract path parameters, which is quite common use case in {rest} {api}s, we can use a routing library, I've used {gomux} and {gin} and I liked more {gin}.

.https://github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest-go/blob/master/main.go[Full example]
[source,go]
----
import (
	"github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest-go/handlers"
	"github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest-go/readers"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	
	// ...

	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/countries", router.Countries)
	r.GET("/countries/:code", router.Country)
	r.GET("/countries/:code/dates", router.CountryDates)
	r.GET("/countries/:code/dates/:date", router.CountryDate)
	r.Run()
}
----

.https://github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest-go/blob/master/handlers/countries.go[And this is a handler example], the router.Countries one
[source,go]
----
func (r *routerImpl) Countries(c *gin.Context) {
	c.JSON(200, r.countries())
}
----

=== Java + Spring.io

The {spring-rest} is based on the concept of Controller, it is implemented using annotations on the class and methods.

.https://github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest/blob/master/src/main/java/com/carlosvin/covid/controllers/CountriesController.java[CountriesController.java,window=_blank]
[source,java]
----
@Validated
@RestController <1>
@RequestMapping("/countries") <2>
public class CountriesController {
	
	// Some source code is not shown, you can find the complete example in the repository 

	@GetMapping("/{country}/dates/{isoDateStr}")  <3>
	public DateStatsDto getDateByCountry(@Size(min = 2, max = 2) @PathVariable String country, @Size(min = 10, max = 20) @PathVariable String isoDateStr) throws NotFoundException {
		return new DateStatsDto(service.getDate(country, DateUtils.convert(isoDateStr)));
	}
}
----
<1> Declare the class as Controller so it is registered in {spring-rest}
<2> Controller base path definition
<3> Handler definition for a nested path under the main controller path. {spring-rest} makes easy to extract path variables defined in the route, you can directly use them as method arguments.

== Validations

=== Go - Gin Framework
{gin} uses an external validation package https://godoc.org/github.com/go-playground/validator[validator], besides that it is fully integrated with {gin}.

[source,go]
----
type User struct {
	Name  string `validate:"required"` <1>
	Email string `validate:"required,email"`
}

err := validate.Struct(user) <2>
validationErrors := err.(validator.ValidationErrors) <3>
----
<1> The validation system uses {go} tags, it is not the same as {java} annotations, but in the validation case, it works in pretty same way as annotations.
<2> Executes the validation explicitly
<3> Extracts validation errors

=== Java + Spring.io
You can enable the validation in the controller, then in the handlers you can specify the type of validation. Let's explain it using the previous example:

.https://github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest/blob/master/src/main/java/com/carlosvin/covid/controllers/CountriesController.java[CountriesController.java,window=_blank]
[source,java]
----
@Validated <1>
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/countries")
public class CountriesController {
	
	// Some source code is not shown, you can find the complete example in the repository 

	@GetMapping("/{country}/dates/{isoDateStr}")
	public DateStatsDto getDateByCountry(
		@Size(min = 2, max = 2) @PathVariable String country, <2>
		@Size(min = 10, max = 20) @PathVariable String isoDateStr) throws NotFoundException {
		return new DateStatsDto(service.getDate(country, DateUtils.convert(isoDateStr)));
	}
}
----
<1> Declare the class as Controller so it is registered in {spring-rest}
<2> `@Size` validates that the input argument country has 2 characters

The validation system is more powerful than you can see in this code snippet, for example adding `@Valid` annotation opens the door to complex types validation.


=== Filtering and Middleware
Different approaches, pretty much the same end result. 

== Dependency injection / IoC

=== {spring-ioc}

{spring-ioc} is the most complete and powerful systems I've ever used for {ioc}, actually, the first time I used Spring professionally was just to deal with {ioc}. It supports XML configuration files or {java} annotations, I like annotations more, here a simple example from {spring-ioc} documentation:

.Spring IoC example
[source,java]
----
@Repository
public class JpaMovieFinder implements MovieFinder { <1>
    // implementation elided for clarity 
}

//

public class SimpleMovieLister {

    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    @Autowired <2>
    public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }

    // ...
}
----
<1> `JpaMovieFinder` is instantiated by {spring-ioc}
<2> With `@Autowired` annotation {spring-ioc} knows that has to inject `movieFinder` argument. It should be a class implementing `MovieFinder`

=== Go

Neither {go} nor {gin} has any {ioc} solution, but you can still apply {di} technique to decouple your components and improve the testability of your system.

.Dependency injection simple example in {go}
[source,go]
----
package main

import "fmt"

// Greeter interface to greet the caller
type Greeter interface {
	greet()
}

type greeterHello struct{}

func (g *greeterHello) greet() { <3>
	fmt.Println("Hello!")
}

type greeterHi struct{}

func (g *greeterHi) greet() {
	fmt.Println("Hi!") <4>
}

// App Application representation
type App struct {
	greeters []Greeter <1>
}

func (app *App) startup() {
	for _, v := range app.greeters {
		v.greet()
	}
}

func main() {
	greeters := []Greeter{ <2>
		&greeterHello{},
		&greeterHi{},
		&greeterHello{}}

	app := &App{greeters}

	app.startup()
}
----
<1> `App` accepts an array of `Greeter`
<2> During `App` instantiation we pass different implementations of `Greeter`
<3> Greeter implementation that prints *Hello!*
<4> Greeter implementation that prints *Hi!*

It is more verbose, but there is an advantage, there is nothing hidden, everything is explicit and you have full control of instantiation order.

As soon as you use {di}, I don't have any strong opinion about using {ioc} system or doing {di} manually.

== Testing

Work in progress...
[source,go]
----
include::di.go[]

=== Unit tests
Not big differences, it comes with golang, Junit in Java.

=== Integration tests
Support out of the box in Spring. 
In go, you have to implement it yourself.

== Performance

Besides the languages specific differences, the main difference is the performance. The CPU consumption in go is smaller, but about the memory the difference is really significant, the order of 30 times smaller fingerprint.

=== Mem
Here I've found a surprising difference, just by checking the memory consumption in my laptop.

- {gin} `15.6MB` 
- {spring-rest} `465.9MB`
