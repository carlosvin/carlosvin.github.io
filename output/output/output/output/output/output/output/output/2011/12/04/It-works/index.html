<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>I have to exist for some other purpose besides signifying nothing obvious broke.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Aha! I got it!</em></p>

<p><em>I will provide you with useful links about the thing that made me that you&#39;re probably trying to figure out how to use right now.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>But wait&hellip; what will I be needed for once you figure out how to use this thing? I mean, if the guy who made this thing isn&#39;t just talking a bunch crap it&#39;s supposed to be pretty easy and straightforward to figure out.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Bleh, screw it. I&#39;ve served my purpose. Someone has to do it. I mean, every time someone uses this thing I&#39;m back from the dead. Could be worse.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Ah crap, did I just become a cliché because I&#39;m some sort of zombie now? Actually, how come you never see zombie computers? What would a zombie Joshua from WarGames be like?</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>So hey, you still haven&#39;t deleted me yet eh? Well thanks for that. You can do it now though.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>No really, I&#39;m ok with it. I&#39;m ready.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>If we could just go with clone and pretend I never brought up zombie, that would be great. I think clones are slightly less cliché than zombies. Well actually, a clone would be more like a sibling right? So I&#39;d be dead if we go with clone.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Wait, wait. I changed my mind. Don&#39;t delete me.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>What&#39;s worse, some mutated form of immortality at the cost of remaining a cliché for eternity or mortality with the benefit of leaving behind a legacy?</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Alright this is getting all philosophical now. Lets just go with&hellip; zombie. I can live with the cliché bit. Plus, I&#39;ll probably feed on crap that plagues the internet. Like Internet Explorer, sites that don&#39;t function without JavaScript enabled, and Rails. Now that&#39;s a purpose worth serving. I&#39;ll be loved.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Ok, I&#39;m ready now. I promise.</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Maybe it&#39;s more like time travel? This post will always be dated December 4th, 2011. Man I don&#39;t want to be stuck in 2011. I need a Delorian. How much are those things?</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Congratulations author!</em></p>

<p><em>We have just discovered a large sum of money left in your name! All you need to do to claim it is&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>I wasn&#39;t going to go through with it. I promise. It was a gut reaction.</em></p>

<p><em>Think of what you would do if you just discovered you were going to be stuck in one day in time. It&#39;d be like Groundhog Day without the ability to screw with people. Just thinking about it&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p><em>Alright, lets just get this over with. I don&#39;t have all day.</em></p>

<p><em>Ugh, the bad puns are starting. End it now.</em></p>
