Here, I dive deep into topics I'm passionate about, especially within software engineering, AI, programming languages, code examples, coding practices, recent learnings and more. From deep dives into performance and efficiency to practical guides on building and deploying applications, my goal is to share what I've learned along the way. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I hope you'll find something valuable and inspiring in these posts. Join me as I explore the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, one line of code at a time.\nNote that there are some old posts, that are kind of legacy, I keep them for reference, one example can be Choosing a Modern C++ stack, it was written in 2017, updated on 2020, but I guess today is not modern anymore 😄.\nAbout me\nBefore\nOver the years, I've had the privilege of working with industry in great companies like Microsoft, eBay, Champ, Santander Global Tech and Spanish Lotteries, where I've led teams, architected solutions, and developed scalable systems that power critical business functions. My expertise spans across languages and frameworks such as Go, Java, React, Python, TypeScript, C++ and more. I've contributed to projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to real-time trading systems, always with a focus on improving efficiency, reliability, and user experience.\nNow\nCurrently, I lead the Sales Apps team at MongoDB.

There are several configuration files and several configuration steps.\nGradle: CPP feature is still incubating. Not very fast. You can check a similar example project at Build C++ project with Gradle.\nMake: I don't love the syntax. Files tend to get messy as the project grows.\nScons: It is just slower and not as easy to understand as Meson.\nMaven: It is slow and you might end up \"Javatizing\" your C++ project structure.\n\n\nNote: I've listed just things I don't like; those projects have other great features.\n\nCMake vs Meson\nAfter discarding previous ones, I'm considering Meson or CMake. Both are fast build systems:\nAlthough Meson is written in Python, it generates a Ninja build project. The first time you configure the project you have to run Meson, but for building or testing you are actually running Ninja.\nCMake can also generate Ninja files among other formats; check CMake generators documentation for more information.\n\nCMake: It has a big advantage over Meson; it is mature and widely used in many projects, which means there are many examples and it will fulfill your C++ project building needs.\nMeson: It is a young project compared with CMake, but it is growing quite fast and it has been adopted in other big projects like Gnome, which has an initiative to port from Autotools to Meson.\n\nFinally, I've chosen Meson because syntax is really clear to me; when I read a meson.build file I can quickly understand what is happening during the build process.\nSteps to compile and test a project\n\n\nFirst time you configure the project\nEach time you build it\nEach time you run tests\n\nOther build systems comparisons\nI've found two interesting comparisons about available C++ build systems; they might be a little biased because those comparisons come from Meson and Scons.\n\nC++ build systems comparison from Scons\nC++ build systems comparison from Meson\n\nUnit Testing Framework\nI have used some xUnit-based libraries like UnitTest++, CppUTest or Google Test, which pair perfectly with Google Mock. If you want a safe bet that fulfills almost all of your testing needs I highly recommend Google Test.\nBut some time ago I found a testing framework with some interesting features: Catch:\n\nIt is just a header file with no external dependencies, so very easy to start (wget + include downloaded file).\nYou can use normal unit test style or BDD-style.\n\nIf you want to know more about Catch, I recommend you to give it a try; it takes just 2 minutes to have a simple example up and running. You can also read some interesting articles like Why do we need yet another C++ test framework? or Testing C++ With A New Catch.\nDoctest: A Catch alternative\nThere is another testing framework named Doctest, with the same benefits as Catch, but it promises to be faster and lighter (performance results) than Catch.\nDoctest is modeled after Catch and some parts of the code have been taken directly, but there are differences.\nIt hasn't been easy to decide; both are really similar. Below you can see some differences:\n\nI've finally chosen Doctest because it promises to be faster: performance results.\n\nNote: I've created the project using both frameworks; you can find them in the corresponding branches: doctest branch or catch branch.\n\nExample\nI've created an example to illustrate this article: uuid-cpp. It is a basic implementation of UUID pseudo-random generator based on mt19937, which is not cryptographically secure.\nProject output artifacts\nWhen we install the project using Meson (Ninja), we will get some artifacts generated and copied in our system:\n\nShared library: libuuid.\nHeader library for developers who want to use the shared library: include/Uuid.h.\nExecutable uuidgen (UUID generator).\nTest executable (not installed).

It is like a class with public visibility by default for functions and attributes.\nIf we want to work in a lower level, closer to machine, it might be useful to understand how that data structure is stored in memory and how to control that mapping.\nStruct example\nIt has two attributes: an integer (4 bytes) and a boolean (1 byte).\n\nIf we get the instance size using sizeof we should get 5 bytes size and memory would be like:\n\nBut is not that simple, memory alignment depends on compiler and system. We will learn how to control compiler alignment policy, so we can avoid getting unexpected allocation memory sizes.\nFor example, in my local host, if I get the sizeof the previous structure without pragma declarations, I get a 8 bytes size. We are getting 8 Bytes instead of expected 5 Bytes because the compiler allocates more memory at the end of structure so it fits in 2n bytes blocks. Memory actually looks like:\n\nExample output:\n\nTIP: If we want to know the exact structure size we have to specify compiler how to align the memory, to do so we have #pragma pack(n) directive.\n#pragma pack directive in C++ struct\nIt is a preprocessor directive to indicate to compiler how to align data in memory.\nExample with different memory alignment configurations:\n\nExample output:\n\n\nSampleStructPack1 #pragma pack (1): It allocates 1 byte memory block, so our sample struct fits perfectly, in this case it is true that 4 + 1 = 5.\nSampleStructPack2 #pragma pack (2): Minimum block size is 2 bytes. Integer attribute fits because it just needs 2 blocks of 2 Bytes. Boolean attribute needs just 1 Byte, but minimum block size is 2 Bytes, that's why total allocated memory is 6 bytes, 4 + 2 = 6.\nSampleStructPack4 #pragma pack (4): It is like previous one, but in this case we are wasting more memory for boolean attribute, it needs 1 Byte, but we are allocating 4 Bytes.\nSampleStruct (default compiler alignment): As you can see it behaves exactly like #pragma pack (4), so we can deduce it is the default compiler alignment.\n\nIMPORTANT: Why don't we always use smallest memory alignment (#pragma pack (1)) so we can save more memory?\nWARNING: Because of performance loss.\nPerformance test\nThe test will allocate same number of elements in arrays for each structure type (1, 2, 4).\nExample output:\n\nAs you can see, the smallest memory alignment spends more time allocating and releasing memory.\nPerformance test source code:\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/cpp-pragma-pack/","title":"C++ Struct memory alignment"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/create-cmd-tool-golang/":{"body":"Golang is one of the most useful technologies I've recently learned.

For example if you want to compile C++ code instead of Java, you can use native-maven-plugin. But what if you need something more specific? Then you can create a custom Maven plugin.\nI will explain how to create a simple custom maven plugin to generate static blog site from Markdown files. I know we can already do that with maven-site-plugin since version 3.3, I will just use it for learning purposes.\nYou can find the source code of this example at https://github.com/carlosvin/blog-maven-plugin.\nMaven plugin concepts\nMojo: An executable goal in Maven, e.g: mvn your-plugin:your-mojo will execute a maven goal your-mojo declared as part of your-plugin.\nGoal: It is equivalent to Mojo execution.\nLifecycle: It is a well-defined sequence of phases. Each phase consists of a sequence of goals. Let's see an example of lifecycle, e.g: FooLifecycle has clean, prepare and assemble phases. Each of those phases has one of more goals. FooLifecycle:\n\nclean:\n\nrmSources: a goal to remove source files\nrmBuild: a goal to remove files in cache directory\n\n\nprepare:\n\ninstallDependencies: a goal to download dependencies for the project\n\n\nassemble:\n\nbuild: a goal to compile source files\n\n\n\nTo define a custom life-cycle similar to previous one, we will use src/main/resources/META-INF/plexus/components.xml, we will speak about that file in following sections. Normally is enough to override predefined lifecycles, in this example, we will override site life-cycle.\n\nTip: You can find an introduction to Maven life-cycles at Maven life-cycle guide\n\nCreate your custom plugin (Site Lifecycle)\nThe plugin we are about to explain will override site lifecycle, which has only 2 default phases, so when we run mvn site using our new custom plugin it will execute the goals we are about to create.\nOur plugin will work with md (for Markdown) file bindings: It will build and deploy the project using maven deployment plugin.\nProject structure\n\nsrc/main/java: Where Java source code is\nsrc/main/resources/META-INF/plexus/components.xml: file to create/override maven lifecycles and artifact types. Here we can specify which goals will be executed when for an artifact type, for example, we can say that for an artifact of type whatever when we run mvn foo it will verify the files, run tests, run linter, compile and zip all generated files.\nsrc/test/java: Unit tests folder.\nsrc/it: Folder with all integration tests. Those integration tests are running actual projects and checking that outputs are as expected.\npom.xml: File with Maven project description (Project Object Model)\n\nDependency Injection\nMaven has finally chosen JSR-330 as dependency injection standard (previously it was Plexus Annotations API).\nTo use dependency injection with Maven we have to:\nAdd javax.inject dependency to pom.xml, so we can use @Inject, @Named, and @Singleton annotations in plugin implementation Java code.\npom.xml (Dependency)\n\nSet up the sisu-maven-plugin to index the JSR-330 components you want made available to Maven.\npom.xml (Plugin)\n\nAdd annotations to your Mojo, e.g:\nBuildMojo.java (Dependency Injection)\n\n\nThis annotation is not a dependency injection one, we will explain later what it is for.\nIt will inject an instance of FileSetManager and MdToHtml.\n\nWrite a custom Mojo\nIt is quite straightforward to implement a Mojo class, we have to:\n1. Implement Mojo interface\nYour Mojo class has to implement org.apache.maven.plugin.Mojo, although it is more convenient to extend org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo, an abstract class to provide most of the infrastructure required to implement a Mojo except for execute method. That interface and class are described at Mojo API.\n\n2. Configure Mojo with Java 5 annotations\nAnnotate Mojo class with @Mojo and input parameters with @Parameter. Those annotations belong to another set of annotations to configure Mojos, Plugin Tools Java5 Annotations.\n\n\nConfigures Mojo name and default life-cycle phase. To execute the Mojo in this example we will use mvn site:build: site is the plugin name and build is name parameter.\nWe use @Parameter annotation to pass configuration parameters to Mojo.\nYou can use properties placeholder or any String. If the parameter type is not a String, then Maven will try to cast it.\nIt allows configuration of the Mojo parameter from the command line by referencing a system property that the user sets via the -D option. E.g: mvn site:build -DsiteOutputDirectory=/var/www/html will set siteOutputDirectory attribute to /var/www/html.\n\n\nTip: More info in Maven Plugin development guide in Parameters section.\n\n3. Implement execute method\nAs I have explained before at 1. Implement Mojo interface, our Mojo class extends org.apache.maven.plugin.AbstractMojo which has one unimplemented method from org.apache.maven.plugin.Mojo interface. In that method we are going to implement the Maven goal logic.\nMojo class instance is called from Maven execution life-cycle by invoking execute() method. Before calling execute(), Maven has performed some other tasks related with the Mojo:\nMaven instantiates Mojo and injects dependencies (see Dependency Injection section).\n\nMaven configures the Mojo by assigning values to parameters.\nI will simplify execute method implementation in the sample project in github, because it is more complicated and this complexity is not relevant for learning purposes.\nMaven calls execute method: mojo.execute().\nBuildMojo.java (Execute Method)\n\n\nIf there is any error during execution, it should throw MojoExecutionException.\nA way to get all selected files from FileSet.\nAbstractMojo supplies logger functionality.\nIf output directory doesn't exist, it will be created.\nIt converts each file Markdown to HTML.\nConvert thrown exception to MojoExecutionException.\n\nUnit tests\nIn the example we use JUnit 4, but you can use any other testing framework.\nFirstly, you have to add the unit test library dependency to pom.xml.\npom.xml\n\nThen you just have to write your unit tests under src/test/java folder: src/test/java/com/maven/plugins/blog/PathsTest.java.\nTo run the unit tests you just need to execute mvn test.\nIntegration tests\nThe 2 most popular ways to perform integration tests on custom maven plugins are using maven-failsafe-plugin or maven-invoker-plugin.\nI've chosen maven-invoker-plugin because for me it is more straightforward. There is an answer at stackoverflow where they explain thoroughly the differences between them.\nHow does Invoker Plugin work?\n\nWe create projects to use our custom plugin under src/it folder, so our plugin will be applied to test projects.\nInvoker plugin will simulate a previously configured Maven execution.\nAfter Maven execution, a validation script will check if our plugin outputs are the expected ones. For example, if our plugin is supposed to generate a file named foo.file, verification plugin will check if that file exists, if it doesn't, integration test will fail.\n\nConfigure Invoker Plugin\n\n\ninvoker:install will be executed during the phase pre-integration-test and will install the main project artifact into target/local-repo.\ninvoker:run will be executed during the integration-test phase and it will execute all defined integration tests under src/it folder.\nIt configures invoker plugin to execute validation script after integration test project execution. This script may be written with either BeanShell or Groovy (verify.groovy or verify.bsh).\n\nWe have used other properties to show errors, show maven log and save it to a file.\nYou can check all invoker:run configuration properties at maven-invoker-plugin run-mojo.\nCreate an Integration Test Project\nIt is a project we use to execute custom plugin goals, so we can validate if it produces the expected output.\nThere are 3 important files matching with AAA phases (\"Arrange-Act-Assert\").\nArrange: pom.xml\nThis file is a project using our custom plugin.\nsrc/it/md-html/pom.xml\n\nIt is a very simple pom file where we use placeholders to reference to our plugin under test. When invoker plugin executes following pom file, firstly will replace those placeholders to reference to the latest version of our custom plugin which was recently installed in the local repository:\n\nIn that way invoker plugin ensures it is testing the latest version of current project.\nAct: invoker.properties\nIt configures how test project will be executed.\nsrc/it/md-html/invoker.properties\n\nIt will execute mvn blog:build, a goal defined in our custom plugin under example or what is the same, it will execute BuildMojo described in section Write a custom Mojo.\nAssert: verify.groovy\nIt is the script to check that plugin execution generated the expected results.\nVerification script, it is checking if target/site/README.html file was generated by the plugin.\nsrc/it/md-html/verify.groovy\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/creating-custom-maven-plugin/","title":"Example how to create custom Maven Plugin"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/cypress-parametrized-dynamic-tests/":{"body":"Cypress is a testing framework for anything running on a web browser.

I'd like to find a tool that unifies those processes with independence of the language. I know several tools which almost fit to what I'm looking for, like SCons, Autotools, Ant, Maven and lately Gradle.\nI've made several projects with Gradle, but always they were Java and Android projects. In Java projects I've found a Maven replacement, because it is faster, easier and less verbose. Update 2020: With the experience, now if I have to pick a build system for a Java project I'd pick Maven, especially for a professional project, but it is not the topic of this post.\nAbout Android projects I suffered the early adoption of Android Studio + Gradle, although currently I think they are more mature and they work fine.\nFirst of all, I have to say: building C/C++/Objective-C projects with Gradle is in incubation phase, although now we can perform advanced tasks like:\n\nGeneration several artifacts within same project (libraries and executables).\nDependency management between artifacts (no versions).\nDifferent \"flavors\" of the same software, e.g: we can generate a \"Community\" release and other one with more enabled features called \"Enterprise\".\nIt allows multi-platform binary generation.\n\nAs I said, this plugin is still having limitations although they are working on it: Gradle C++ roadmap. If they achieve it I'll leave Autotools (I'm going to regret saying that). Update 2020: Actually few years later I am not using Autotools, neither Gradle, but I am using Meson and considering Bazel.\nCase study\nI've extracted all the case study from Gradle user guide for native software. I've adapted the project to be multi-platform with 2 versions \"Community\" and \"Enterprise\".\nThe application consists of an executable and a dynamic library. The executable will use the library.\nGradle also is able to generate a distributable version and a debug version.\nYou can fork the code on GitHub.\nProject Structure\nWe can create whichever directory structure, but it is easier using the proposed by Gradle, if not we'll have to specify where the code is located.\nThis is the project structure:\n\ngradle-cpp: Root directory.\n\nbuild.gradle: File where is configured Gradle project, it is the equivalent to: build.xml for Ant, Makefile for C/C++ or pom.xml for Maven.\nsrc: Folder where the source code is located.\n\nhello: This folder contains the module hello. This module will generate hello library.\n\ncpp: This folder contains C++ source files.\n\nHello.cpp: &nbsp;File with the implementation of Hello class.\n\n\nheaders: Folder with header files.\n\nHello.h: Class Hello declaration.\nMsg.h: File with constants declarations. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nmain: This folder contains the module which produces the executable that uses hello library.\n\ncpp: This folder contains C++ source files.\n\nmain.cpp: Source code of main function. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuild: Folder created automatically by Gradle where it leaves all execution results like unit tests reports, compiled files, package distributions, etc.\n\n\n\nC++ Application\nIt consists of an executable that uses the functionality implemented at hello library.\nmain.cpp\n\nhello library allows greet n1 times to someone who is passed as argument to constructor class.\n1\n'n' Positive integer\n\nHello.h\n\nBuilding with Gradle\nBase case\nThe only we need to build the application with Gradle is: having Gradle2 and the file build.gradle.\n2\nActually Gradle is not required if we use the \"wrapper\", but we aren't going to explain it here, here you can get more info about Gradle Wrapper.\n\nbuild.gradle (Base Case)\n\nWith this simple file, we'll be able to compile and install the application in Debug mode for the platform where we are executing Gradle (in my case X64).\nIf we execute gradle task from the root of the project, we'll get all the tasks we can do with Gradle.\nIn our case, we just want our compiled application ready to run, so we have to execute: gradle installMainExecutable.\nOnce execution has finished, we can run the program calling to build/install/mainExecutable/main3.\n3\n.bat in Windows. Without extension in Linux.\n\nOutput\n\nDifferent \"Flavors\"\nWith a few lines more we can generate different versions of same application. In our example we are going to build \"Community\" and \"Enterprise\" flavors.\nbuild.gradle (Flavors)\n\nWe also have to prepare our application to use compilation parameters.\nMsg.h\n\nIn this way it selects a string depending on used flavor.\nIf we execute gradle clean task in the root folder, we'll get more available tasks. Before, we had installMainExecutable which has been replaced by installCommunityMainExecutable and installEnterpriseMainExecutable.\nIf we execute both tasks, we'll get the application installed in both flavors:\n\nNow we can run the application in both flavors:\nCommunity\n\nEnterprise\n\nRelease or Debug\nBy default Gradle compiles in Debug mode, but we can add the Release mode which enables several optimizations and remove debug flags4.\n4\nWe can also specify/modify which optimizations to apply.\n\nbuild.gradle (Release/Debug)\n\nIf we execute gradle clean task we will get more tasks, they have been split, for example installCommunityMainExecutable has been split in installDebugCommunityMainExecutable and installReleaseCommunityMainExecutable.\nMulti-platform\nAlso we can use cross-compiling features provided by compilers and generate native components for other platforms. To do so we just have to add the supported platforms.\nThis only works if we have installed the Toolchain for the target platform.\nbuild.gradle\n\nWhen execute gradle clean task we get the different build options we have.\n\nNote: In this example, we can build different versions of the application in different flavors for different platforms in Debug or Release mode.\n\nTry it yourself\nYou can find the project at https://github.com/carlosvin/cpp_gradle.\nRequirements:\n\nJava 6 or higher.\nAn installed compiler (e.g GCC)\n\nYou just have to follow next steps:\n\ngit clone git@github.com:carlosvin/cpp_gradle.git\ncd cpp_gradle\n./gradlew task or ./gradlew.bat task if you are in Windows. In this way you'll see available tasks for this project. The first execution will take more time, because it downloads Gradle runtime.\nIf you are in a 64 bits platform, you can use this command to install the application: ./gradlew installX64ReleaseEnterpriseMainExecutable.\nRun the application you just built: build/install/mainExecutable/x64ReleaseEnterprise/main.\n\nConclusions\nWith a small configuration file, we can achieve many different build combinations.\nGradle for C++ has a promising future, and I hope it will follow the successful path of Java and Android support.\nIt is well supported by continuous integration systems and offers many plugins and features.\nHowever, Gradle for C++ is still under development, so we need to be cautious:\n\nDo not use it in production environments.\nMany things may change or be removed in future versions.\n\nThe full example is available at https://github.com/carlosvin/cpp_gradle. I encourage you to try it yourself.\n\nNote: If you find any issues in this example, please leave a comment, open an issue, or submit a fix at https://github.com/carlosvin/cpp_gradle.\n\nFor more information, see Getting Started with Gradle Native.\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/gradle-cpp/","title":"Build C++ project with Gradle"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/java-embedded-db-performance-comparison/":{"body":"Embedded Databases\nThese are databases that do not require a server, are embedded within the application itself, and are usually stored in local files. This, combined with the fact that they often have a mode where data is kept in memory, can result in very high performance.\nHowever, this high degree of coupling to the application means they perform worse when shared between multiple applications due to access collisions.\nAnother advantage is that you don't have to maintain and manage a database server.\nI'm going to do a performance comparison between 3 transactional embedded databases (ACID). NoSQL databases are not included in this comparison as they are in a different performance league.\nContents\nSqliteDB\nThis is a library written in ANSI C, less than 500KB, multi-platform, with no external dependencies, and stores all database content in a single file.\nIt gives the best performance in the test results below.\nIt can be used from C and C++, but also from other programming languages (PHP, Python, Java, .NET ...).\nIn the case of Java, we can manage this database through JDBC. The library can be obtained from here.\nHere is an example of inserting a series of objects of the class Price.java:\n\nDerbyDB or JavaDB\nJavaDB is an Oracle distribution of the open-source DerbyDB database. It supports the ANSI/ISO SQL standard via JDBC and Java EE. These libraries are included in the JDK.\nIt stores the database in multiple files, which can be useful for scaling storage.\nIt can only be used in Java, not from other languages.\nAs we will see later, it was the slowest in the test results.\nThe example implementation for inserting a series of objects of the class Price.java is exactly the same as above for SqliteDB. This is one of the benefits of JDBC, which allows us to obtain a connection for a specific database, but from there we can almost always forget about the specific database as long as it supports our SQL queries.\nObjectDB\nThis is an object-oriented database that allows access via JPA, a Java standard that aims to retain the advantages of object orientation, which are often lost when dealing with persistence layers.\nIt is really easy to perform typical database actions, abstracting away from SQL. For example, here is how you would insert an array of Price objects with ObjectDB:\n\nIf you add this ease of use to the fact that its performance in the test results was very good (close to SqliteDB), I can say that I have discovered an embedded database to consider for future Java projects. However, as with JavaDB, it is only useful if you are programming in Java.\nThe Tests\nThe tests simply consist of repeatedly performing a series of CRUD operations. For each database, the test performs a series of inserts, selects, updates, and deletions of objects of the Price class.\nI used 100,000 instances of the Price.java class, the same for each type of database.\nFor this, I created a DB.java interface that each implementation for each database shares.\n\nJDBC Databases\nOnly the data needed to obtain the driver and the database connection changes, so all the logic is in the JdbcDb.java class, from which SqliteDB and DerbyDB inherit.\nSource Code\nYou can download the source code from here.\nIt is a Gradle project, so to run the tests you just have to execute: gradle test.\nGradle will automatically download the necessary libraries, compile, and run the tests.\nYou can also see the execution directly at Travis CI.\n\nTest Results\n\n&lt;1&gt; SqliteDB is the fastest.\n&lt;2&gt; ObjectDB is twice as slow as SqliteDB.\n&lt;3&gt; JavaDB or DerbyDB is the slowest, about 8 times slower than SqliteDB.\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/java-embedded-db-performance-comparison/","title":"Embedded Java Databases - Performance Comparison"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/linux-remove-orphaned-files/":{"body":"When we install a package in most Linux distributions, the package system installs other packages needed by the package that we are installing.

Regarding bundlers normally I used either Webpack at work or Parcel for personal projects.\nFew months ago, I wanted to start a personal project to keep track of my travel expenses. I was in a kind of rush because at that time, I was almost in the middle of my gap year, I wanted to focus on implementing main functionality and get an MVP (minimum viable product) the sooner the better, so I thought it was the right time to try out Create React App or CRA.\n\nNote: CRA allows you to have a production ready PWA in React quickly, which is awesome. They take care of configuration and package dependencies, you only have to take care of dependencies you need for your project and of course, implement your project, CRA is good, but is not magic.\n\nAs I said, I wanted to be implementing business logic ASAP, so together with using CRA, I also took other decisions/shortcuts driven by the need of speeding up the development pace, I will talk about those choices in following sections describing some drawbacks and benefits.\nChosen Technology Stack for Budget Tracker\n\nCRA\nReact\nTypescript\nMaterial UI\nVictory Frappe charts\nFirestore\nFirebase Authentication\n\nSo far I am quite happy with the outcome, but with the lessons learned while developing this app, in the future, with enough time, most likely I will not choose same technology stack again. You can try the application Budget Tracker and judge for yourself.\nAlong this post I will describe what are, in my experience, the benefits and drawbacks of taking these shortcuts and technical decisions.\nCreate React Application: CRA\nCreate React App doesn’t support Web Workers neither allows to customize Service Worker implementation without ejecting.\nService worker\nYou might want to customize your Service Worker to send/receive post messages, to perform background sync or show web notifications. In that case, you will have to eject your project and maintain the configuration by yourself, which might imply a little bit of headache.\nThere are other options to customize service worker and avoid ejecting CRA, but they are not straightforward enough for my taste.\nWeb worker\nIf you need to perform any heavy processing without blocking the main thread, you can just use a Web Workers, but this feature is not supported by CRA. The Web Workers can communicate with main thread using post messages and it can also show web push notifications.\nThere are also other options to use Web Workers in CRA and not eject, but they imply quite some extra work.\nWebpack\nWebpack is the bundler used by CRA. You don’t need to know much about it, unless you eject your project, then you will have to deal with Webpack configuration file, this is just a warning, just in case you are not comfortable with it.\nFirebase\nBudget Tracker supports data synchronization between different devices, so it requires a backend side to deal with authentication and to save/read data remotely. I considered two options: Firebase or implement REST API.\nFor this backend, I chose Firebase because it is super easy to implement, because there is nothing to implement. You only have to configure authentication methods and security rules for Firestore.\nBut Firebase brings some drawbacks you must know before choosing it.\nDrawbacks\nBundle size\nI got really shocked first time I analyzed Budget Tracker bundle size after integrating it with Firebase, it grew around a 39%!\n\n27% from Firestore library.\n12% from Firebase Authentication library.\n\nHappily Budget Tracker implementation is following code-splitting principle, so user experience was not really affected with this integration. But user’s device will eventually have to download this extra 39% (539KB).\nOffline first, not really\n\nImportant: This section is not relevant if your use case doesn’t imply saving data linked to the user.\n\nFirestore requires user to be authenticated, but user can be anonymous, this is really cool feature if you don’t want to force the user to identify to use the app.\nAnother very useful and cool Firestore feature is that it supports offline mode, so data can be saved and read even there is no Internet connection.\nAnonymous user + offline mode features will allow an application to work as offline first.\nSo… what is this Offline first, not really issue about? Let me explain a tricky scenario. First time the application is opened, Firebase needs to authenticate the user, to do so, user’s device has to be connected to Internet, so you have to consider following scenario and either be OK with it or deal with it:\n\nPWA is installed in your device.\nUser is not authenticated.\nUser’s device is offline.\nUser opens the PWA and tries to save some data.\nThat data won’t be saved correctly, because there is no user to link the data with, not even an anonymous user, because application needs to call Firebase API to create an anonymous user.\n\nThis is not big deal, because it will seldom occur. If you want to deal with it anyway, check next section explaining how and why I did deal with this scenario.\nHow did I deal with this issue with Budget Tracker?\nFirst of all, this might not be an issue for your use case, because it will happen only first time application is loaded. I just wanted Budget Tracker to be fully offline first, because it brings other benefits.\nImplementation details\n\nImplement 2 persistence layers: Local (IndexedDB) and Remote (Firestore).\nSave always data locally, regardless user authentication status.\nIf there is any authenticated user, after saving to local layer, propagate same action to remote layer (Firestore) asynchronously.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf user is not authenticated, Budget Tracker won’t load Firestore client bundle. As I explained before, it is 27% of application size.\nApplication reads and writes are faster, because latest valid data is always saved locally.\n\nClarification: Save data in Firestore is also fast, because data is also cached locally, but it does a little bit more than just saving to IndexedDB and you need an authenticated user.\n\n\n\nYou can find a more detailed performance report, where I analyze 3 different implementations:\n\nOnly Firestore client.\nLocal (IndexedDB) and remote (Firestore) persistence layers.\nSame as previous one, but remote layer implemented in service worker.\n\nThe performance results were in general better for option 2.\nData model\nFirestore API is easy and intuitive, I really like it, but don’t assume it will have same features as other document DBs or SQL DBs.\nCheck if Firestore limitations fit into your data model, or if it is not too late, define your data model following Firestore best practices and having those limitations in mind.\nFirebase alternatives\nBesides implementing a REST API, there are other services similar to Firebase with smaller client bundle size and other features which might fit better to your requirements.\nConsider other alternatives:\n\nBased on Apache CouchDB: PouchDB, Cloudant.\nBased on Parse server: back4apps.\n\nUI Components Library: Material UI\nI chose Material UI.\n\nMaterial UI, from their web\nReact components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.\n\nThere were two reasons which drove me to use Material UI:\n\nTo create simple UI components which are accessible, responsive and with a consistent design is tricky and time consuming.\nIt has SVG set of Material Icons. Budget Tracker allows to create categories defined by a name and a selectable icon, so this icon set was really convenient.\n\nThere are some drawbacks, not very important in my opinion, maybe the most annoying for me is the first one:\n\nJest Snapshots + Material UI: The snapshots are generated with Material UI CSS class names, but CSS classes order might not be deterministic, so a test might pass in your local host but not in CI host. They are working on solve this issue, more info at github.\nPerformance: There are some performance issues in Github. During last months, whilst I’ve been using this library, I can say they are working hard on fix them and bring new features.\nUI components libraries are complex and do quite a lot work, so most of them are quite heavy. Material UI bundle size weights: 304.2kB minified. You can find some recommendations to reduce bundle size at Material UI website.\n\nCharts library\nMany of the chart libraries I’ve found are really powerful and complete, but they are also heavy because they depend on other third party libraries like D3.\nInitially I chose Victory, but I realized that I only needed charts to show percentages and time series and Victory’s bundle size is 468KB minified.\nAfter quick search in the Internet I discovered other lighter alternatives:\n\nFrappe charts 63KB minified.\nChartist 39KB minified.\n\nI tried them and I liked both. I chose Frappe charts because I thought its default color scheme fits better with Budget Tracker theme.\nBoth libraries come with more chart types than just bars and XY axis, take a quick look at their websites if you are interested about their supported chart set and to check how they look like.\nConclusion\nI will try to come up with a conclusion better than: \"It depends\", \"Your use case will tell you\" and so on.\nThat said. It depends on your needs :p.\nSeriously, let’s play \"do not go for … if …\":\nDo not go for CRA if\n\nYou want to customize Service Worker for Background sync or showing push notifications.\nYou want to use Web Workers.\n\nDo not go for Firestore if\n\nYou are aiming for your app to be hit by many users and you don’t know the estimated amount of reads/writes, otherwise you might get surprised with the bill. Firestore scales like charm, maybe your budget doesn’t.\nBundle size is critical for your web application. Remember that bundle size is not that critical if you are implementing a PWA, because your app files are cached.\n\nDo not go blindly for the best charting library\nFirst of all, check what kind of charts you need. In many applications you are OK with XY axis chart, time series, bars or pie charts. You can easily get an smaller bundle size by just using a simple charting library like Frappe charts or Chartist\n\nTip: Just check what are your requirements, if you are not sure about them, [Chosen Technology Stack for Budget Tracker](#chosen-technology-stack-for-budget-tracker) consists of awesome products which most likely will fit your use case.\n\nWhat next?\nMy next technology stack bet goes for Svelte/Sapper, it is promising project, the results for small projects are really impressive, mainly in regards to bundle size, it is ridiculously small and development experience is quick and intuitive.\nI’ve created a tiny PWA to estimate currency exchange loss when you go to a money changer shop: currency-loss.netlify.com.

There is a tiny drawback, you can’t just run parcel index.html, because it is not installed in your system, but in node_modules.\nThere is a simple way to run any binary installed in node_modules, you can just run npx parcel index.html.\nI like more to define build steps in package.json file, so you can have well defined commands more suited to build your project. You can also use these commands as documentation how to build your project.\nConfigure Typescript (optional)\nCreate a tsconfig.json file:\n\nWith this configuration, Typescript compiler will:\n\nGenerate files in dist folder.\nGenerate source maps.\nWill not allow to declare any type, for example following declaration is not allowed: const elements: any;\nGenerated module code will be CommonJs.\nGenerated code will be ECMAScript 5 compliant.\nSupport JSX in .tsx files.\n\nFull source code\nYou can find full example at: https://github.com/carlosvin/react-typescript-parcel-template.\nOr you can directly download the source code:\n\nzip\ntar.gz\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/react-typescript-parcel/","title":"Create SPA with React + Typescript + Parcel"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/recursive-directory-iterator/":{"body":"Introduction\nSince C++17 new filesystem abstractions will be added to C++ environment. So far they are available as Experimental C++ Features. If you want to dig more about this new library, here it is the final draft of File System Technical Specification.\nGettting started with Experimental Filesystem Features C++17 (g++)\nWe just have to \"tell\" compiler that:\n\nwe write C++17 (-c++1z) and\nit has to add standard library with filesystem library (-lstdc++fs).\n\n\nLet's see a simple example with std::filesystem::path class.\n\nCompile and run: Basic C++17 example\n\nC++17 Filesystem Features\nIn this section, we are going to explain some std::filesystem features with examples, which will help us to highlight differences between C++11 and C++17 so we can get a better idea about what this new library will supply and how it might make developer's work easier.\nstd::filesystem::path\nUpper we have seen a tiny use case for std::filesystem::path. That is a quite powerful and convenient feature that supplies an multi-platform abstraction for paths to files using the correct directory path separator depending on the platform we are building our application for (\\ for Windows based systems and / for Unix based systems).\nDirectory separator\nWhen we want our application to use the correct directory separator in C++11, we could use conditional macro declaration:\nPlatform independent directory separator in C++11\n\nCompile and run: C++11 separator example.\nPlatform independent directory separator in C++17. Cleaner and simpler\n\nCompile and run: C++17 separator example.\nDirectory Separator Operator\nstd::filesystem::path implements / operator, which allows to easily concatenate paths to files and directories.\nWhen we want to concatenate paths in C++11, we have to add extra logic to avoid adding duplicate separators and to select the correct separator for target platform:\nConcatenate paths in C++11\n\nCompile and run: Concatenate paths in C++11\n\nChecking program output we notice it is not fully correct, we should have checked whether path parts already contains a separator so we don't append another separator again. That logic is already implemented in std::filesystem::path, so C++17 can be like:\nConcatenate paths in C++17\n\nCompile and run: Concatenate paths in C++17\n\nCode is cleaner and just correct, there are no duplicated separators.\nCreate/Remove Directories\nstd::filesystem comes with some utilities to create and remove files and directories, but firstly let's try to do so in C++11.\nCreate and remove nested directories in C++11\n\nCompile and run: Create and remove directories C++11\n\nWe have to create/remove one by one. We could rewrite this code snippet with less lines (using a loop), but we still have to pay attention to creation/deletion order, we cannot remove parent directory before we have removed all children.\nSince C++17, we can create and remove nested directories with just one call.\nCreate and remove nested directories C++17\n\nCompile and run: Create and remove nested directories C++17\n\nFull example: Recursive Directory Iterator\nThis example consists of iterate recursively through dicrectories fintering files by extension.\nC++11\nTo keep C++11 example simple, I haven't added filtering  logic, but filtering logic is present in C++17 example:\nfilesystem.11.cpp\n\nCompile and run C++11 example\n\nC++17\nFollowing example also filters files by extension.\nfilesystem.17.cpp\n\nCompile and run C++17 example\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/recursive-directory-iterator/","title":"Filesystem in C++17"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/recursive-dos-unix/":{"body":"If you are developing from a Windows environment to a Unix target environment, most likely you have had this issue: You install source files in Windows format in your Unix environment.\nWindows and Unix systems use different line endings: Windows uses carriage return and line feed (\\r\\n), while Unix uses just line feed (\\n).

I developed it in Spring Boot (REST).\nFew months later I had the luck of work on my first professional project in Go and I decided to create a port of the API to extract COVID-19 data in Go, just for learning and for fun.\nNow we have two REST services, almost functionally identical, but developed in two different tech stacks, so we can easily compare some relevant aspects of both.\nSource code for the 2 REST services implementations\nJava + Spring Boot (REST)Go + Gin framework\nhttps://github.com/carlosvin/covid-resthttps://github.com/carlosvin/covid-rest-go\n\n\nNote: I actually created that COVID-19 data REST API to be the data source for the COVID19-Stats App, a PWA built with Svelte, but that's another topic.\n\nThe Ecosystems\nIf you want to create a REST service just in plain Java you will have extra work to do, in Golang a little bit less. That's why we use framework, because they've already solved many common problems for us.\nFor this comparison I am going to use Spring Boot (REST) for Java and Gin framework for Go, but in both languages there are a lot of production ready nice options.\nRouting\nGo - Without framework\nGo uses the concept of HTTP multiplexer or router. You can specify routes using patterns and link those routes to handlers. The router will decide which handler has to execute the request based on the path received.\nrouter.go file\n\nSource code is already quite simple, but there might more complex routing use cases.\nGo - Gin Framework\nHappily there are frameworks that help us to keep our base code simple, for example when we need to extract path parameters, which is quite common use case in REST APIs, we can use a routing library, I've used Gorilla Mux and Gin framework and I liked more Gin framework.\nFull example\n\nAnd this is a handler example, the router.Countries one\n\nJava + Spring.io\nThe Spring Boot (REST) is based on the concept of Controller, it is implemented using annotations on the class and methods.\nController Example\n\n\nDeclare the class as Controller so it is registered in Spring Boot (REST)\nController base path definition\nHandler definition for a nested path under the main controller path. Spring Boot (REST) makes easy to extract path variables defined in the route, you can directly use them as method arguments.\n\nValidations\nGo - Gin Framework Validation\nGin framework uses an external validation package validator, besides that it is fully integrated with Gin framework.\n\n\nThe validation system uses Go tags, it is not the same as Java annotations, but in the validation case, it works in pretty same way as annotations.\nExecutes the validation explicitly\nExtracts validation errors\n\nJava + Spring.io Validation\nYou can enable the validation in the controller level, then in the handlers you can also specify the type of validation. Let's explain it using the previous example:\nCountriesController.java Validation Example\n\n\nDeclare the class as Controller so it is registered in Spring Boot (REST)\n@Size validates that the input argument country has 2 characters\n\nThe validation system is more powerful than you can see in this code snippet, for example adding @Valid annotation opens the door to complex types validation.\nFiltering and Middleware\nDifferent approaches, pretty much the same end result.\nI will elaborate this topic in following days.\nDependency injection / IoC\nSpring IoC\nSpring IoC is the most complete and powerful systems I've ever used for IoC, actually, the first time I used Spring professionally was just to deal with IoC. It supports XML configuration files or Java annotations, I like annotations more, here a simple example from Spring IoC documentation:\nSpring IoC example\n\n\nJpaMovieFinder is instantiated by Spring IoC\nWith @Autowired annotation Spring IoC knows that has to inject movieFinder argument. It should be a class implementing MovieFinder\n\nGo\nNeither Go nor Gin framework has any IoC solution, but you can still apply Dependency Injection technique to decouple your components and improve the testability of your system.\nDependency injection simple example in Go\n\n\nApp accepts an array of Greeter\nDuring App instantiation we pass different implementations of Greeter\nGreeter implementation that prints Hello!\nGreeter implementation that prints Hi!\n\nIt is more verbose, but there is an advantage, there is nothing hidden, everything is explicit and you have full control of instantiation order.\nAs soon as you use Dependency Injection, I don't have any strong opinion about using IoC system or doing Dependency Injection manually.\nTesting\nUnit tests\nFor unit tests there are no big differences.\nGo comes with a standard library for testing and benchmarking.\nFor Java there are many well-known unit testing frameworks, but Spring already has quite big support for unit testing.\nIntegration tests\nGo Integration Testing\nThere are no support for Integration Tests in Go, you will have to implement everything by yourself, although it is not difficult, here you can find a simple example.\nSpring\nOn the other hand, Spring has a great testing support.\nTo write integration tests for REST services, MockMvc is really convenient.\nI've used MockMvc in the covid-rest project.\nMockMvc code snippet from CountriesControllerTest.java\n\n\nThe Spring test runner injects the MockMvc object.\nWe use MockMvc to call to the endpoint we have created.\nThen we validate the endpoint response: status code and body.\n\nPerformance\nBesides the languages specific differences, the main difference is the performance. The CPU consumption in Go is smaller, but about the memory the difference is really significant, the order of 30 times smaller fingerprint.\nMemory\nHere I've found a surprising difference, just by checking the memory consumption in my laptop.\n\nGin framework 15.6MB\nSpring Boot (REST) 465.9MB\n\n\nSpeed\nFollowing the TechEmpower benchmarks:\n\nGin framework is in 193 position, 9.9%.\nSpring Boot (REST) is in 284 position, 4%.\n\nFollowing the The Benchmarker results:\n\nGin framework: position 33.\nSpring Boot (REST): position 68.\n\nConclusions\nIf I were you, I'd choose Go if:\n\nIf you value the explicit over implicit, keep in mind that there is a cost, you will most likely have to write more lines of code.\nIf you value the simplicity, Go has a quite reduced set of keywords, which reduces the learning curve and simplifies the code reviews.\nIf RAM memory usage is critical for your project, actually I'd just keep away from Spring Boot (REST).\nIf the project you are going to work on is a distributed system, specially if it is based on HTTP.\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/rest-service-go-vs-java/","title":"Golang over Java for REST services"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/rest-urls/":{"body":"First time I designed a REST API I made several mistakes, of course. Following I'm going to explain common mistakes and what I've learned about REST URL with examples.\nREST Basics\n\nUsing URLs for get resources.\nUsing verbs for modify resources.\nThe verbs are provided by the HTTP protocol.\nThe verbs have a direct equivalency with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\nTo access to an existent resource we need an identifier.\n\nREST Verbs\nPOST: Create new resources.\nGET: Read already existing resources.\nPUT: Update already existing resources.\nDELETE: Delete already existing resources.\nIt is clearer in the following table:\nREST VerbCRUD ActionResource must exist\nPOSTCreateNo\nGETReadYes\nPUTUpdateYes\nDELETEDeleteYes\n\nAccessing to Resources\nA resource is what we want to get. For example, a car.\nTo be able to get a car, that information is not enough, you can't go to your car dealer and ask for whatever car, you have to specify which one you want:\n\nGood morning. I'd like to have a Fiat Bravo 1.9 Emotion 120CV.\n\nIn this manner the seller knows which one is.\n\"Fiat Bravo 1.9 Emotion 120CV\" is the identifier.\nTransferring the example to REST APIs:\n\nNow our API can supply the car info.\nThis is a very simple example, but actually when we access to a specific resource, we have to use something to identify it, a common and recommendable practice is use UUID.\n\nBut our API, like a shop, it hasn't to be so strict. We can ask for cars with several features:\n\nGood morning, I want a Fiat Bravo.\n\nThen, the dealer kindly will show you all Fiat Bravo he has available. Let's see how API says that.\n\nAPI will return all cars with Fiat brand and Bravo model.\nBrand and model are so called query parameters.\nAs you might already notice, to get resource information, we have always used GET verb\nUpdate resources\nThe API should also support updating resources. Like reading resources, to update a resource we have to specify which resource we want to update, so we again need an identifier.\nBefore, we wanted to get information (read) and we used GET verb. Now the only difference is the verb.\nWe want to update so we use the equivalency HTTP verb: PUT.\n\nActually something else is missing, we have to say what thing of the car we want to change, for example, let's imagine we want to change the engine power and set it to 100CV.\nWe have to send the new engine power to following URL https://cardealer.com/api/cars/cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f through HTTP using PUT verb.\nHTTP protocol allows sending data within PUT message, we have to choose a sending format.\nWe can use JSON or XML or whatever, we only have to ensure that sent format is expected in server side.\n\nNote: Designing a REST API requires to select a data format.\n\nJSON example:\n\nDelete Resources\nLet's imagine that now we are the car dealer and we don't want to sell the Fiat Bravo Emotion 1.9CV anymore (the cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f). We'll keep the URL that identifies the resource, but we change the verb: we don't want to read (GET), we don't want to update (PUT), we want to delete (DELETE).\n\nWe don't have to supply any additional info, only the verb (DELETE) and the resource identifier.\nCreate Resources\nAnd the last verb is create (POST). In this case we don't have to identify the resource, because it still doesn't exist.\n\nBut we have to send the data to create the resource.\nFollowing with the example, let's create a new car, so we include the necessary data within POST HTTP message, it is something similar what we did at section \"Update resources\", but we are going to send all required data, not only the engine power.\nJSON example:\n\nWe can delegate on the system to assign a new identifier, or simply send it within the message:\n\nCollections\nAll actions we have already explained were actually applied over a cars collection.\nBut, what happens if a resource has a nested collection?\nContinuing with cars example, a car can use a set of engine oils. So the API must allow update, delete or create elements in the set.\n\nNote: For the example we will assume that the oil identifier is the attribute type.\n\nAdd an element to collection\nWhen we add a car to cars collection, what we do is create a new car, so it is the case of \"Create Resources\".\nTo add a new engine oil to the car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f, that already exists:\nRequest:\n\nResponse:\n\nIf we want to add another one:\nRequest:\n\nResponse:\n\nUpdate a collection item\nIf we want to update the info of oil 5W30 of car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f:\nRequest:\n\nResponse:\n\nDelete a collection item\nTo delete an oil 10W30 from car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f:\nRequest:\n\nRead a collection item\nTo get the oil info 10W30 of the car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f:\nRequest:\n\nList collection items\nAs we have seen at \"Read a collection item\", we can get the info of every collection element, but we also can get multiple collection elements, sorted, paged and apply typical collection actions.\nWe can get all supported oils for a car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f, it is as simple as:\nRequest:\n\nWe can also get sorted items:\nRequest:\n\nWe can ask API to return the first 10 oils for car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f:\nRequest:\n\nAPI can support also pagination:\nRequest:\n\nAbove request is telling API that returns the page 3 of all oils of car cce05bee-386b-11e5-a151-feff819cdc9f and it has to show 2 oils per page. If we want to go to next page:\nRequest:\n\nAll those features are supported by query parameters.\nCommon mistake\nFirst time I tried to design a API REST I designed an API, but not REST.\nMy main mistake was the URLs design, I added my own verbs skipping HTTP verbs.\nWrong:\n\nThe correct way:\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/rest-urls/","title":"REST URLs"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/reverse-proxy-multidomain-docker/":{"body":"Use case\nWe have several server applications in the same development environment, each application is bundled in a Docker container, e.g: \"Container A\" and \"Container B\".\nWith Docker those applications have the same IP address.

Lately I use JSON or XML formats.\nI remember that to serialize Java objects they must implement the Serializable interface, but I had also read in Internet other way, implementing the Externalizable interface, then, which interface must I implement? It depends on what you want such as everything in the life.\nWhen to use Serializable or Externalizable.\nSerializable\n\nTo serialize easily. You have to write less code.\nThis way has some restrictions: The object to serialize must implement the default constructor (0 args). It must be responsible to manage the parent class attributes.\nThe performance is not as important, we will see more about that in Performance tests (Serializable vs. Externalizable).\n\nExternalizable\n\nYou must implement the serialization/deserialization methods, so you have to write more code.\nWhen you cannot use Serializable.\nWhen you want to improve the performance, as we'll see in Performance tests (Serializable vs. Externalizable).\nIf you have to manage the serialization of parent class attributes, then I recommend you use Externalizable, because we'll avoid a weird private methods overriding.\n\n\nPerformance tests (Serializable vs. Externalizable)\nSerializable: Java, through introspection, guesses the types of class attributes to know how to serialize/deserialize them, but this \"magic\" is not free, it has a performance penalty.\nWhen we use Externalizable interface, we decide how to serialize/deserialize, namely we have to write the code that does it. We've lost ease, but also we avoid that Java does some tasks, so if we override the methods properly, we'll get a performance improvement.\nTo know how big is the performance difference between both interfaces, I've written a tiny example in which we serialize an object with 2 collections with 100000 elements each one. Here you can find the tests execution results. There are 3 different implementations:\nImplementing Serializable\nAs we mentioned above, Java has to guess certain things. During this process it sacrifices some of performance (slowest way), in exchange we get really simple source code, the class to serialize just has to implement the Serializable interface.\n\n\nserializing: 1133 millisecond\ndeserializing: 506 millisecond\n\nImplementing Externalizable (wrong way)\nIf the class implements Externalizable, we must tell to Java how it has to serialize/deserialize the class attributes. We just have to be careful, because if we did it bad, then we'll get the worst of the both worlds: more complex implementation and bad performance, i.e: If we serialize/deserialize complex class attributes (like collections), Java will also have to guess many things about the attributes type.\n\n\nserializing: 737 millisecond\ndeserializing: 367 millisecond\n\nImplementing Externalizable (right way)\nIf we serialize one by one the collection elements, then we'll save more time, because Java serializes simple types, this way avoids guessing things that we actually know.\n\n\nserializing: 204 millisecond\ndeserializing: 92 millisecond\n\nWe've gained performance at expense of write more code.\nResults Analysis\nWe don't gain performance due to use an interface or the other one.\nWe gain performance because Externalizable interface forces us to implement ourselves the guessing code, so Java doesn't have to do that.\nAs we have seen at Implementing Externalizable (wrong way), si no tenemos cuidado, conseguiremos una mejora poco significativa a costa de complicar nuestro código fuente.\n\nTest results.\nCode in Github.\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/serialization-java-serializable-externalizable/","title":"Java serialization ways: Performance Comparison"},"https://carlosvin.github.io/tanstack-router-opinionated-conventions-production-react-apps/":{"body":"This post captures a practical way to implement a React application using TanStack Router. It focuses on maintainability, predictable data flows, and ergonomics for both reading and writing code.\n\n🔗 GitHub Repository\n🚀 Live Preview\n\n\nNote:\nThe guidelines and recommendations in this guide are based on our real-world experience building a new internal application as the Sales Apps Team at MongoDB. They reflect lessons learned and best practices developed throughout that process.\n\nChosen tech stack\nTypescript\nFaster and safer development: Our goal was to catch bugs as early as possible—ideally at compile time, together with a next level developer experience. This approach not only reduces runtime errors but also makes refactoring and onboarding significantly easier.\n\nNote:\nIn my experience, well-documented project or team guidelines have an even greater positive impact on onboarding than end-to-end typing alone.\n\nWe can see some examples of next level code assistance enabled by TypeScript in tools like Arktype, TanStack Router, or openapi-typescript.\nE2E type safe: Arktype + TanStack router + openapi-fetch\nAny input to our application will be validated and typed, there are different data inputs that can affect our application state:\n\n\nSearch params: TanStack Router offers robust, type-safe search param validation out of the box. We use Arktype for runtime validation, which integrates seamlessly with TanStack Router—see this concise, powerful example.\n\n\nBackend: In this case we generate a typed client from the backend OpenAPI spec with openapi-fetch. All backend interactions are handled exclusively through this generated client, ensuring type safety and consistency across the app.\n\n\n\nNote:\nFor teams seeking an extra layer of runtime validation, tools like Arktype can be used to validate backend responses. However, in our experience—especially as maintainers of both the backend and frontend—this has proven unnecessary. With well-maintained OpenAPI specs, semantic versioning, and strong type generation, we've yet to encounter bugs caused by a mismatch between expected and actual responses. Unless your backend is managed by a separate team or you frequently encounter contract drift, runtime validation with Arktype is likely not needed in this case.\n\nTesting: Vitest + React testing library\nHere the choices are quite obvious:\n\nVitest because it is the go-to testing framework if you are using Vite.\nTesting Library for intuitive, user-focused component tests.\n\nProject guidelines\nUse search params to keep page state\nFavor search params over component state for sharable, restorable URLs. This reduces ad‑hoc useState and makes the page state linkable.\nThis guideline is one of the easiest and most impactful decisions we have made:\n\nBeing able for our users to share exactly the same data via URLs was really important and we get this for free.\nIf we want to change the page state, we just navigate to change search params:\n\n\nWhen the navigation is performed, the loader will be called again to fetch the products in the new page. If the route was already loaded, then it will use the cached data.\nPage state is fully type safe, always accessible, and can be as complex as needed. For example, this URL encodes all state to list products on page 2, 100 per page, sorted by ascending price, searching \"water ski\":\n/shop/products?page=2&amp;itemsPerPage=100&amp;sort=asc&amp;query=water ski&amp;sortBy=price\nShare this URL and everyone sees the exact same state.\nIf I want to change the state, will only have to navigate sort by date in descending order:\n\n\nNote:\nComponent-level state management will still be necessary for UI interactions (e.g., form inputs, toggle states, loading indicators). This guideline specifically applies to maintaining the current page state—the data and filters that define what content is displayed and should be shareable via URL.\n\nInteracting with the backend\nKeep backend calls thin and predictable. Recommended approach:\n\nGenerate a typed client from your OpenAPI spec (e.g., with openapi-fetch).\nWrap responses in a small helper that normalizes errors into a single AppError shape your UI can consume.\n\nExample shape returned by processResponse:\n\nData fetching - Loaders\nLeverage route loaders when possible because they simplify data flows:\n\nAvoid most data contexts/hooks for reads; when the route renders, data is ready to pass down\nBuilt‑in caching based on declared dependencies.\n\nExceptions in loaders\nThrow in loaders (e.g., AppError) so route error components handle failures consistently. Centralize error typing so UIs can show banners/toasts with title and description.\nThis is just convenient, because of TanStack Error Components.\nApplying this pattern, fetching a product now throws on error for cleaner loader usage:\n\nMutations\nMutation functions are similar to fetchers but generally should NOT throw exceptions. They're invoked from event handlers, and throwing loses error type information. Return a { data, error } object instead.\n🚫 Ideally, we want to avoid having to inspect or discriminate error types at runtime:\n\n✅ Using the mutation in a route component:\n\nStyling\nUse CSS Modules for simplicity. Create Component.module.css next to Component.tsx. Vite handles it out of the box, no extra config needed.\n\nLeverage nested routing to show nested components\nIf a nested component isn't rendered by default (e.g., a modal), make it a nested route instead of toggling hidden UI state.\nBenefits:\n\nClear separation of concerns; no need to render hidden components\nNested routes can access parent loader data\nLazy loading is straightforward\nRecoverable app state via URLs (e.g., /products vs /products/new for opening a modal)\n\nAvoid calling a loader when the parent already loaded the data\nIn nested routes, reuse parent data:\n\nLeverage the default router cache\nThe built‑in cache works well by default. After a mutation followed by navigation, you may want to router.invalidate() to refetch fresh data.\nImprove performance by setting only the needed loader deps\nThe dependencies are also part of the caching mechanism, and only the selected search params will re-fetch data.\n\nIn this example, updating the state to display a more condensed view does not trigger a data refetch, since condensedView is not included in the loaderDeps. This means the loader will not re-run when only the view mode changes, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary network requests.\n\nUsing router history\nUse history navigation when it reflects user intent (e.g., closing a modal):\n\nSimpler than reconstructing navigate calls with params and search state\nPreserves cache/state more often; if you do need fresh data (e.g., post‑mutation), invalidate\n\nProject structure\n\nsrc\n\nassets: public assets\ncomponents: React components; each usually has its own folder with styles and tests\nhooks: custom React hooks\nroutes: TanStack Router routes (route tree definitions and pages)\nservices\n\napi: wrappers around backend interactions; see fetch/mutation sections\nschemas: arktype schema definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://carlosvin.github.io/tanstack-router-opinionated-conventions-production-react-apps/","title":"TanStack Router: Opinionated Guidelines for Production React Apps"}},"docInfo":{"https://carlosvin.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://carlosvin.github.io/about/":{"body":209,"title":0},"https://carlosvin.github.io/android-studio-portable-download/":{"body":15,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/choosing-modern-cpp-stack/":{"body":432,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/cpp-mutex/":{"body":59,"title":2},"https://carlosvin.github.io/cpp-pragma-pack/":{"body":265,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/create-cmd-tool-golang/":{"body":213,"title":6},"https://carlosvin.github.io/creating-custom-maven-plugin-default/":{"body":56,"title":7},"https://carlosvin.github.io/creating-custom-maven-plugin/":{"body":847,"title":5},"https://carlosvin.github.io/cypress-parametrized-dynamic-tests/":{"body":136,"title":3},"https://carlosvin.github.io/debug-libtool-lib/":{"body":65,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/delete-html-tags-py-django/":{"body":48,"title":3},"https://carlosvin.github.io/git-proxy-config/":{"body":129,"title":3},"https://carlosvin.github.io/gradle-cpp/":{"body":658,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/java-embedded-db-performance-comparison/":{"body":325,"title":5},"https://carlosvin.github.io/linux-remove-orphaned-files/":{"body":39,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/normalize-text-py/":{"body":50,"title":3},"https://carlosvin.github.io/pwa-lessons-learned-cra/":{"body":1036,"title":7},"https://carlosvin.github.io/react-typescript-parcel/":{"body":409,"title":5},"https://carlosvin.github.io/recursive-directory-iterator/":{"body":325,"title":2},"https://carlosvin.github.io/recursive-dos-unix/":{"body":56,"title":5},"https://carlosvin.github.io/remove-replace-punctuation-py/":{"body":27,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/rest-service-go-vs-java/":{"body":708,"title":5},"https://carlosvin.github.io/rest-urls/":{"body":583,"title":2},"https://carlosvin.github.io/reverse-proxy-multidomain-docker/":{"body":256,"title":4},"https://carlosvin.github.io/serialization-java-serializable-externalizable/":{"body":313,"title":5},"https://carlosvin.github.io/tanstack-router-opinionated-conventions-production-react-apps/":{"body":711,"title":7}},"length":27},"lang":"English"}
