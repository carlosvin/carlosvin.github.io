# Choosing a Modern C++ stack

Iâ€™m starting a new project in C++, but Iâ€™ve run into a couple of questions before starting:

1. Which build system should I use?
2. Which unit testing framework?

**ðŸ’¡ TIP**\
If you just want project template so you can have a C++ project skeleton ready in seconds, just go to https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp and follow the [instructions in README.md,window=blank_](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/README.md).

## Choosing Build System (https://mesonbuild.com/[Meson,window=_blank])

I have used before [Make,window=_blank](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html), [Maven,window=_blank](https://maven.apache.org/), [Scons,window=_blank](https://scons.org/), [Gradle,window=_blank](https://gradle.org/) and [Autotools,window=_blank](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html), but I have some reasons to try find something else:

* **[Autotools,window=_blank](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)**\
  It is not easy to configure and maintain. There are several configuration files and several configuration steps.
* **[Gradle,window=_blank](https://gradle.org/)**\
  C++ feature is still incubating. Not very fast. You can check a similar example project at [Build C++ project with Gradle](/posts/gradle-cpp/).
* **[Make,window=_blank](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)**\
  I donâ€™t love the syntax. Files tends to get messy as project grows.
* **[Scons,window=_blank](https://scons.org/)**\
  It is just slower and not as easy to understand than [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/).
* **[Maven,window=_blank](https://maven.apache.org/)**\
  It is slow and you might end up "_Javatizing_" your C++ project structure.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
Iâ€™ve listed just things I donâ€™t like, those projects have other great features.

### https://cmake.org/[CMake,window=_blank] vs https://mesonbuild.com/[Meson,window=_blank]

After discarding previous ones, Iâ€™m considering [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/) or [CMake,window=_blank](https://cmake.org/). Both are fast build systems:

Although [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/) is written in [Python,window=_blank](https://python.org/), it generates a [Ninja,window=_blank](https://ninja-build.org/) build project. First time you configure the project you have to run [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/), but for building or testing you are actually running [Ninja,window=_blank](https://ninja-build.org/).

[CMake,window=_blank](https://cmake.org/) is also able to generate [Ninja,window=_blank](https://ninja-build.org/) files among other formats, [check CMake generators documentation for more information](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

* **[CMake,window=_blank](https://cmake.org/)**\
  It has a big advantage over [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/), it is mature and widely used in many projects, which means there are many examples and it will fulfill your C++ project building needs.
* **[Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/)**\
  It is a young project compared with [CMake,window=_blank](https://cmake.org/), but it is growing quite fast and it has been adopted in other big projects like link:[Gnome], they have an initiative to [port from Autotools to Meson](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting).

**Finally Iâ€™ve chosen** [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/) because syntax is really clear to me, when I read `meson.build` file I can quickly understand what is happening during build process.

**Steps to compile and test a project**

```bash
$ meson build .  â‘ 
$ cd build
$ ninja build    â‘¡
$ ninja test     â‘¢
```
1. First time you configure the project
2. Each time you build it
3. Each time you run tests

### Other build systems comparisons
Iâ€™ve found two interesting comparisons about available C++ build systems, they might be a little be biased because those comparisons come from [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/) and [Scons,window=_blank](https://scons.org/).

* [C++ build systems comparison from Scons](https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons/wiki/SconsVsOtherBuildTools).
* [C++ build systems comparison from Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Simple-comparison.html).

## Unit Testing Framework

I have used some [xUnit,window=_blank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) based libraries like [UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp), [CppUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/) or [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) which match perfectly with [Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock). If you want a safe bet that fulfills almost of your testing needs I highly recommend [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest).

But time ago I found a testing framework with some interesting features, [Catch,window=_blank](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch):

* It is just a header file with no external dependencies, so very easy to start (wget + include downloaded file).
* You can use normal unit test style or link:[BDD]-style

If you want to know more about [Catch,window=_blank](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), I recommend you to give it a try, it is a matter of 2 minutes to have a [simple example up and running](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#writing-tests). You can also read some interesting articles like [Why do we need yet another C++ test framework?](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/why-catch.md) or [Testing C++ With A New Catch](https://blog.coldflake.com/posts/Testing-C++-with-a-new-Catch/).

### https://github.com/onqtam/doctest[doctest,window=_blank]: A https://github.com/philsquared/Catch[Catch,window=_blank] alternative

There is another testing framework named [doctest,window=_blank](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest), with same benefits as [Catch,window=_blank](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), but it promises to be faster and lighter ([performance results](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/benchmarks.md)) than [Catch,window=_blank](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch).

[doctest,window=_blank](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) is modeled after [Catch,window=_blank](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) and some parts of the code have been taken directly, but there are [differences](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/faq.md#how-is-doctest-different-from-catch).

It hasnâ€™t been easy to decide, both are really similar, following you can see differences:

Iâ€™ve finally chosen [doctest,window=_blank](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) because it promises to be faster: [performance results](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/benchmarks.md).

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
Iâ€™ve created project using both frameworks you can find them in corresponding branches: [doctest branch](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/tree/doctest) or [catch branch](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/tree/catch).

## Example

Iâ€™ve created an example to illustrate this article: https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp.

It is a basic implementation of UUID pseudo-random generator based on  [mt19937,window=_blank](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/mt19937) which is not cryptographically secure.

### Project output artifacts

When we install the project using [Meson,window=_blank](https://mesonbuild.com/) ([Ninja,window=_blank](https://ninja-build.org/)), we will get some artifacts generated and copied in our system.

* Shared library: `libuuid`.
* Header library for developers who want to use the shared library: `include/Uuid.h`.
* Executable `uuidgen` (link:[UUID] generator).
* Test executable (not installed). It tests shared library.

For example, if you execute `ninja install` on Linux, you will get something like:

```bash
/usr/local/lib/libuuid.so
/usr/local/include/Uuid.h
/usr/local/bin/uuidgen
```

### Project structure (https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp[Fork project])

* **[meson.build](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/meson.build)**\
Root project file configuration. It defines project properties and subdirectories.

**meson.build**

```python
project(
    'cpp-meson-example', # project name
    'cpp', # C++ project, e.g: for C project
    version : '1.0.0',
    license : 'MIT',
    default_options : ['cpp_std=c++11']) # compile for C++

# it will be referred from subdir projects
inc = include_directories('include')

# meson will try to find a meson.build file inside following directories
subdir('include')
subdir('src')
subdir('test')
```

* **[include](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/include/)**\
  meson.build;; Build configuration file for include directory.
  
.include/meson.build
```python
# Select header files to be installed
install_headers('Uuid.h')
```

      https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/include/Uuid.h[Uuid.h];; Header file, it is the library interface definition which will be included from projects using that library

**include/Uuid.h**

```cpp
namespace ids {

class Uuid {
    private:
    // ...
```

* **[src](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src)**\
  
  [meson.build (src)](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src/meson.build);; It declares 2 output artifacts, library `libuuid` and executable `uuidgen`. Executable depends on the libary, it will use the libary to generate [UUID,window=_blank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

**src/meson.build**

```python
libuuid = shared_library(
    'uuid', â‘ 
    'Uuid.cpp', <2> 
    include_directories : inc, â‘¢
    install : true) â‘£

uuidgen = executable(
    'uuidgen', â‘¤
    'main.cpp', â‘¥
    include_directories : inc, â‘¦
    link_with : libuuid, â‘§
    install : true) â‘¨
```
1. library name
2. source files to be compile
3. previously declared include directories in root `meson.build`
4. `libuuid` will be part of project installation
5. executable name
6. source files to compile
7. previously declared include directories in root `meson.build`
8. linking executable with shared previously declared shared library `libuuid`
9. `uuidgen` executable be part of project installation

       https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src/main.cpp[main.cpp];; Entry point for main executable `uuidgen`.

**src/main.cpp**

```cpp
#include "Uuid.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    ids::Uuid uuid;
    std::cout << uuid.to_str() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

    https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src/Uuid.cpp[Uuid.cpp];; Implementation of declared class in header file.

**src/Uuid.cpp**

```cpp
#include "Uuid.h"

Uuid::Uuid()
{ // ...
```

* **[test](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/test/)**\
  [meson.build (test)](https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/test/meson.build);; File to configure tests build process.
    
.test/meson.build
```python
testexe = executable(
    'testexe', â‘ 
    'uuid_test.cpp', â‘¡
    include_directories : inc, â‘¢
    link_with : libuuid) â‘£

test('Uuid test', testexe) â‘¤

test('Uuid test with args and env', testexe, args : ['arg1', 'arg2'], env : ['FOO=bar']) â‘¥
```
  1. test executable name
  2. tests source files to be compiled
  3. declared include directories in root `meson.build`
  4. link test executable with previously declared shared library `libuuid`
  5. test execution
  6. we can specify other test execution passing arguments or environment variables

         doctest.h;;
           {doctest} library in a single header file. You can try to automate library installation as part of your build process, but I haven not figured out yet a way to do it with {meson}. For now, I have installed it manually:

**Add [doctest,window=_blank](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) to your project**

```bash
cd test
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onqtam/doctest/master/doctest/doctest.h
```

    https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/test/uuid_test.cpp[uuid_test.cpp];;
      Tests implementation.

**test/uuid_test.cpp**

```cpp
#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN

#include "doctest.h"
#include "Uuid.h"
#include <string>

constexpr int MAX_ITERS = 100;

TEST_CASE("Uuid")
{
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ITERS; i++)
    {
        ids::Uuid uuid;
        std::string uuid_str{uuid.to_str()};

        INFO(uuid_str);

        // If assertion fails test execution is stopped
        REQUIRE(uuid_str.size() == 36);

        // If assertion fails test execution continues
        CHECK(uuid.most > 0);
        CHECK(uuid.least > 0);
    }
}

// BDD style

SCENARIO("UUID creation")
{

    GIVEN("A random UUID ")
    {

        ids::Uuid uuid;
        std::string uuid_str{uuid.to_str()};

        REQUIRE(uuid_str.size() == 36);

        WHEN("get the most and least")
        {
            THEN("should be more than 0")
            {
                CHECK(uuid.most > 0);
                CHECK(uuid.least > 0);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
