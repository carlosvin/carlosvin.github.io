{"html":"<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I&#8217;m doing some experiments with <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rust</a> because it is a language that promises to be as fast as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">C/C++</a>, but safer in regards to memory management. Essentially, it doesn&#8217;t allow the developer to do \"bad things\" with the memory like: forget releasing that is not going to be used anymore or release memory still in use.
