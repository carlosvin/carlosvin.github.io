Welcome to my [blog](/blog), where you can find [posts](/blog) about various topics that interest me, mainly about software engineering, programming languages, code examples, recent learnings, and more.

<small>Note that there are some old posts, that are kind of legacy, I keep them for reference, one example can be [Choosing a Modern C++ stack](./blog/choosing-modern-cpp-stack), it was written in 2017, updated on 2020, but I guess today is not modern anymore :smile:.</small>

If you want to know more about me, you can check my [about page](/about).
