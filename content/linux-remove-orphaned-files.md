When we install a package in most Linux distributions, the package system installs other packages needed by the package that we are installing. If we uninstall the package, its dependencies might not be uninstalled; these unused dependencies are called orphaned packages.

Let's see how to remove orphaned packages.

## Archlinux

```bash
pacman -Rsn $(pacman -Qdtq)
```

How does the command work?

- `pacman -Qdt` lists all orphaned packages
- `pacman -Rsn` uninstalls the listed packages

## Debian

```bash
apt-get remove --purge $(deborphan)
```
