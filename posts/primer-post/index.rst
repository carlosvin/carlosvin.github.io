I guess that most people come from dynamic content management systems based on:

* send data from browser to server 
* process the received data, then it stores the info into a database (or files) 
* the server generate dynamically an answer that is sent to the browser as HTML

  * the answer is usually built reading info from a database or files.

This process is managed by a software installed on server, this is our content management system.

Now I've changed the paradigm to "static web site generator", specifically I'm going to use Nikola_, 
although this time, I'm not going to install on a remote server. 

In a next post I'll tell you how I've automated the publication process using Github_ [#]_ and Travis_ [#]_.

.. TEASER_END

PhpNuke_
--------
My first content management system, yes it still exists. It based on PHP+MySQL, multi-lang, user management, user groups, theming, plugins, etc. 

My Own Content Management System
--------------------------------
It wasn't a full [CMS]_, because actually it was a blogging system. I can publish posts dynamically, it was made with PHP and MySQL. It was useful to: 

* Publish posts (with several problems). 
* I realized that a developer needs a designer. 
* I don't like the PHP_ syntax. 
* I began to understand the importance of [DRY]_.

Drupal_
========
A full [CMS]_,  I liked it until things began to "break" (Maybe I broke some of them). But Drupal_ has everything you expect from a [CMS]_ and more. 

Wordpress_
==========
I don't know if it is better or worse than Drupal_, there are many discussions on the Internet, but I can tell Wordpress_ is more usable and easier to update than Drupal_. 

CMSdj_
=======
It is my second attempt to create my own [CMS]_. I had an idea in my mind about how to make the core design (the data model), I still believe in that design. I had also discovered Django_, I liked this framework developed in Python_, who can resist creating their own [CMS]_? 
CMSdj_ is in Bitbucket_ and is working, it has its internal search engine, theming, comment system, voting system,HTML5_ + CSS3_ views, but: 

* I didn't have enough time to develop it, two hours per week at most. 
* I still needed a designer.

So, I declared the project CMSdj_ dead out of boredom, although it was supporting my old blog, when I went to write something, I saw my unfinished project, I didn't like it, so I decided to close it and begin a new one.

Nikola_
=======
I wanted a static website generator because they are trendy. 
I tried Jekyll_ because it's the most famous, but I prefer one written in Python_. So, after a quick search I had three finalists: Nikola_, Mynt_ and Pelican_. I chose Nikola_  because I discarded the others:
* Pelican_ throws some multi-lang problems with the categories. I didn't want to spend time researching about how to fix them. 
* I love the simplicity of Mynt_, but you have to create your own themes. 


.. [#] Github_ hosts the generated site, the static files (html, css, images, js).
.. [#] Travis_ is a continuous integration software (like Jenkins_). I use it to automate the site deployment: download the files when they change from Github_, re-generate and re-publish the static files.
