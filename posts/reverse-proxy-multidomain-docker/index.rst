Use case
--------

We have several server applications in the same development environment, each application is bundled in a Docker container, e.g: "Container A" and "Container B".

With Docker those applications have the same IP address. One way to differentiate and access to an specific application is exposing different ports.

.. thumbnail:: /galleries/docker-multidomain/ip.png

  Containers exposing the same IP address and different ports

- If we want to call to "Application A" we will do: GET http://10.20.30.40:8080/colors/red
- If we want to call to "Application B" we will do: GET http://10.20.30.40:8081/fruits/tomato

But that solution is a little bit confusing, does 8080 mean we are accessing to "application A"?

It would be simpler and easier to remind something like:

- Calling "Application A": GET http://a.domain.com/colors/red
- Calling "Application B": GET http://b.domain.com/fruits/tomato

  Accessing applications by domain name

Get that extra semantic value is much simpler than I thought at the beginning and you will see below.

How to Configure Multi-Domain Reverse Proxy
-------------------------------------------

I said it is easy, because we almost have to do nothing, another container will do it for us, especifically we are going to use nginx-proxy_, it will automatically generate the required NGINX_ configurations.

So, we will have 2 applications + 1 proxy, that is 3 containers.

.. note:: You can download the full example at  https://github.com/carlosvin/docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain

  3 containers, 2 applications + 1 proxy

Example Project Structure
=========================

- docker-compose.yaml (Main configuration file describing architecture in previous picture)

- a (Application A directory)

  * Dockerfile (Container A configuration file)

- b (Application B directory)

  * Dockerfile (Container B configuration file)

`Ver proyecto </listings/docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain>`_.

Architecture Configuration (docker-compose)
===========================================

The relationships between containers is the most interesting part in this example.

.. listing:: docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain/docker-compose.yaml yaml
  :number-lines:

- Lines 4 and 10: we configure the domain name for each application.

- From line 13 there is proxy configuration (copy/paste part).

- In lines 2 and 8 we tell docker-compose has to build Docker images within specified directory. For example, in line 2, we are saying that docker-compose has to build a Docker image using ./a/Dockerfile file.

Application Image Configuration
===============================

.. listing:: docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain/a/Dockerfile docker
  :number-lines:

Line 1: We import an image with an apache server.

Line 2: It serves a file that prints "Host A" as default page.

The configuration for application B is pretty much the same:

.. listing:: docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain/b/Dockerfile docker
  :number-lines:

Adding domain names to your development environment configuration
=================================================================

In Linux we just have to map the local address to domain names you have chosen, in the example  a.domain.com and b.domain.com.

.. code-block:: bash
  :number-lines:

  #/etc/hosts
  127.0.0.1		localhost.localdomain localhost
  ::1		      localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
  127.0.0.1   a.domain.com
  127.0.0.1   b.domain.com

I just added 4 and 5 lines.

Everything ready!
=================

Now we just have to test the example:

.. code-block:: bash
  :number-lines:

  docker-compose build
  docker-compose up

The 3 containers are running now.

So we can open our favourite web browser and go to a.domain.com. It will show *App A works!*. If we go to b.domain.com then we will see *App B works!*.

.. thumbnail:: /galleries/docker-multidomain/a.screenshot.png

  a.domain.com

.. thumbnail:: /galleries/docker-multidomain/b.screenshot.png

  b.domain.com


.. note:: In most of Linux distros you will need privileges to run Docker commands (sudo).
