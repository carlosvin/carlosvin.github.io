.. type: text

I'm starting a new project in C++, but I've run into a pair of questions before start:

1. Which build system should I use?
2. Which unit testing framework?

.. TEASER_END

Choosing Build System (Meson_)
==============================

I have used before Make_, Maven_, Scons_, Gradle_ and Autotools_, but I have some reasons to try find something else:

Autotools_
    It is not easy to configure and maintain. There are several configuration files and several configuration steps. 
    
Gradle_ 
    C++ feature is still incubating. Not very fast. You can check a similar example project at `Build C++ project with Gradle </posts/gradle-cpp/>`_.

Make_
    I don't love the syntax. 
    Files tends to get messy as project grows.
    
Scons_
    It is just slower and not as easy to understand than Meson_.

Maven_
    It is slow and you might end up "*Javatizing*" your C++ project structure.

.. note:: I've listed just things I don't like, those projects have other great features. 

After discarding previous ones, I'm considering Meson_ or CMake_. 

CMake_ vs Meson_
-----------------

CMake_ 
    It has a big advantage over Meson_, it is mature and widely used in many projects, which means there are many examples and it will fulfill your C++ project building needs. 

Meson_ 
    It is a young project compared with CMake_, but it is growing quite fast and it has been adopted in other big projects like Gnome_, they have an initiative to `port from Autotools to Meson <https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting>`_. 

**Finally I've chosen** Meson_ because:

- Syntax is really clear to me, when I read `meson.build` file I can quickly understand what is happening during build process. 
- It is fast. Altought it is written in Python_, it generates a Ninja_ build project. First time you configure the project you has to run Meson_, but for building or testing you are actually running Ninja_.

.. code:: bash

    $ meson build . # first time you configure the project
    $ cd build
    $ ninja build   # each time you build it
    $ ninja test    # each time you run tests

I've found two interesting comparisons about available C++ build systems, they might be a little be biased because those comparisons come from Meson_ and Scons_.

- `C++ build systems comparison from Scons <https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons/wiki/SconsVsOtherBuildTools>`_.
- `C++ build systems comparison from Meson <http://mesonbuild.com/Simple-comparison.html>`_.

Unit Testing Framework
======================
I have used some xUnit_ based libraries like `UnitTest++ <https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp>`_, `CppUTest <http://cpputest.github.io/>`_ or `Google Test`_ which match perfectly with `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock>`_. 
If you want a safe bet that fulfills almost of your testing needs I highly recommend `Google Test`_.  

But time ago I found a testing framework with some interesting features, Catch_: 

- It is just a header file with no external dependencies, so very easy to start (wget + include downloaded file).
- You can use normal unit test style or BDD_-style

If you want to know more about Catch_, I recommend you to give it a try, it is a matter of 2 minutes to have a `simple example up and running <https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#writing-tests>`_. You can also read some interesting articles like `Why do we need yet another C++ test framework? <https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/why-catch.md>`_ or `Testing C++ With A New Catch <http://blog.coldflake.com/posts/Testing-C++-with-a-new-Catch/>`_.

doctest_: A Catch_ alternative
------------------------------

There is another testing framework named doctest_, with same benefits as Catch_, but it promises to be faster and lighter (`benchmark results`_) than Catch_. 

doctest_ is modeled after Catch_ and some parts of the code have been taken directly, but there are `differences <https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/faq.md#how-is-doctest-different-from-catch>`_.

It hasn't been easy to decide, both are really similar, following you can see differences:

I've finally chosen doctest_ because it promises to be faster: `benchmark results`_.

.. note:: I've created project using both frameworks you can find them in corresponding branches: `doctest branch <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/tree/doctest>`_ or `catch branch <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/tree/catch>`_. 


Example
=======

I've created an example to illustrate this article: https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp.

It is a basic implementation of UUID pseudo-random generator based on mt19937_ which is not cryptographically secure.

Project output artifacts
------------------------

When we install the project using Meson_ (Ninja_), we will get some artifacts generated and copied in our system.

- Shared library: :code:`libuuid`.
- Header library for developers who want to use the shared library: :code:`include/Uuid.h`.
- Executable :code:`uuidgen` (UUID_ generator).
- Test executable (not installed). It tests shared library. 

For example, if you execute :code:`ninja install` on Linux, you will get something like:

.. code:: bash
    
    /usr/local/lib/libuuid.so
    /usr/local/include/Uuid.h
    /usr/local/bin/uuidgen

Project structure (`Fork project <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp>`_)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `meson.build <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/meson.build>`_
    Root project file configuration. It defines project properties and subdirectories.
    
    .. code:: python
    
        project(
            'cpp-meson-example', # project name
            'cpp', # C++ project, e.g: for C project 
            version : '1.0.0',
            license : 'MIT',
            default_options : ['cpp_std=c++11']) # compile for C++

        # it will be referred from subdir projects
        inc = include_directories('include') 

        # meson will try to find a meson.build file inside following directories
        subdir('include')
        subdir('src')
        subdir('test')

* `include <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/include/>`_
    - meson.build
        Build configuration file for include directory.

        .. code:: python

            # Select header files to be installed 
            install_headers('Uuid.h')

    - `Uuid.h <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/include/Uuid.h>`_
        Header file, it is the library interface definition which will be included from projects using that library

        .. code:: cpp

            namespace ids {

            class Uuid {
                private:
                // ...


* `src <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src>`_
    - `meson.build (src) <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src/meson.build>`_
        It declares 2 output artifacts, library :code:`libuuid` and executable :code:`uuidgen`. Executable depends on the libary, it will use the libary to generate UUID_.
        
        .. code:: python

            libuuid = shared_library(
                'uuid', # library name
                'Uuid.cpp', # source files to be compile
                include_directories : inc, # previously declared include directories in root :code:`meson.build`
                install : true) # :code:`libuuid` will be part of project installation

            uuidgen = executable(
                'uuidgen', # executable name
                'main.cpp', # source files to compile
                include_directories : inc, # previously declared include directories in root :code:`meson.build`
                link_with : libuuid, # linking executable with shared previously declared shared library :code:`libuuid`
                install : true) # :code:`uuidgen` executable be part of project installation

    - `main.cpp <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src/main.cpp>`_
        Entry point for main executable :code:`uuidgen`

        .. code:: cpp

            #include "Uuid.h"
            #include <iostream>

            int main() 
            {
                ids::Uuid uuid;
                std::cout << uuid.to_str() << std::endl;
                return 0;
            }

    - `Uuid.cpp <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/src/Uuid.cpp>`_
        Implementation of declared class in header file.

        .. code:: cpp

            #include "Uuid.h"

            Uuid::Uuid()
            { // ...

* `test <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/test/>`_
    - `meson.build (test) <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/test/meson.build>`_
        File to configure tests build process. 

        .. code:: python

            testexe = executable(
                'testexe', # test executable name 
                'uuid_test.cpp', # tests source files to be compiled
                include_directories : inc,  # declared include directories in root :code:`meson.build`
                link_with : libuuid) # link test executable with previously declared shared library :code:`libuuid`

            # test execution 
            test('Uuid test', testexe)

            # we can specify other test execution passing arguments or environment variables
            test('Uuid test with args and env', testexe, args : ['arg1', 'arg2'], env : ['FOO=bar'])

    - doctest.h
        doctest_ library in a single header file. You can try to automate library installation as part of your build process, but I haven't figure out yet a way to do it with Meson_. For now I've installed it manually: 
        
        .. code:: bash

            cd test
            wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onqtam/doctest/master/doctest/doctest.h 

    - `uuid_test.cpp <https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/test/uuid_test.cpp>`_
        Tests implementation.

        .. code:: cpp

            #define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN

            #include "doctest.h"
            #include "Uuid.h"
            #include <string>

            constexpr int MAX_ITERS = 100;

            TEST_CASE("Uuid")
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ITERS; i++)
                {
                    ids::Uuid uuid;
                    std::string uuid_str{uuid.to_str()};

                    INFO(uuid_str);

                    // If assertion fails test execution is stopped
                    REQUIRE(uuid_str.size() == 36);

                    // If assertion fails test execution continues
                    CHECK(uuid.most > 0);
                    CHECK(uuid.least > 0);
                }
            }

            // BDD style

            SCENARIO("UUID creation")
            {

                GIVEN("A random UUID ")
                {

                    ids::Uuid uuid;
                    std::string uuid_str{uuid.to_str()};

                    REQUIRE(uuid_str.size() == 36);

                    WHEN("get the most and least")
                    {
                        THEN("should be more than 0")
                        {
                            CHECK(uuid.most > 0);
                            CHECK(uuid.least > 0);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
