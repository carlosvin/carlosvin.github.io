:toc:

{cpp11} has added many improvements to help us developing multi-thread systems. I'm going to talk about {mutex}.

In {prev_vers}, we can get a {pthread} {mutex}, but we must initialize it and destroy it in old C style, in the end you must do more things than just lock/unlock.

With {cpp11_mutex}, we just lock/unclock the object. 

[source, cpp]
----
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx;

void do_something (int i) {
  mtx.lock();
  // critical section
  mtx.unlock();
}
----

Or you can just use {mutex} with a https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard[generic lock guard,window=_blank].

TIP: If you still have to stick to {prev_vers}, maybe it is useful to you a wrapper class I created that helps you to work with {pthread} {mutex}, so you just have to lock/unlock the Mutex object: {gist}.
