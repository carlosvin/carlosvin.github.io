I'm starting a new project in C++, but I've run into a couple of questions before starting:

. Which build system should I use?
. Which unit testing framework?

TIP: If you just want project template so you can have a C++ project skeleton ready in seconds, just go to https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp and follow the https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/blob/master/README.md[instructions in README.md,window=blank_].

== Choosing Build System ({meson})

I have used before {make_link}, {maven}, {scons}, {gradle} and {autotools}, but I have some reasons to try find something else:

{autotools}::
  It is not easy to configure and maintain. There are several configuration files and several configuration steps.
{gradle}::
  C++ feature is still incubating. Not very fast. You can check a similar example project at link:/posts/gradle-cpp/[Build C++ project with Gradle].
{make_link}::
  I don't love the syntax. Files tends to get messy as project grows.
{scons}::
  It is just slower and not as easy to understand than {meson}.
{maven}::
  It is slow and you might end up "_Javatizing_" your C++ project structure.

NOTE: I've listed just things I don't like, those projects have other great features.

=== {cmake} vs {meson}

After discarding previous ones, I'm considering {meson} or {cmake}. Both are fast build systems:

Although {meson} is written in {python}, it generates a {ninja} build project. First time you configure the project you have to run {meson}, but for building or testing you are actually running {ninja}.

{cmake} is also able to generate {ninja} files among other formats, https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html[check CMake generators documentation for more information].

{cmake}::
  It has a big advantage over {meson}, it is mature and widely used in many projects, which means there are many examples and it will fulfill your C++ project building needs.
{meson}::
  It is a young project compared with {cmake}, but it is growing quite fast and it has been adopted in other big projects like link:[Gnome], they have an initiative to https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting[port from Autotools to Meson].

*Finally I've chosen* {meson} because syntax is really clear to me, when I read `meson.build` file I can quickly understand what is happening during build process.

.Steps to compile and test a project
[source,bash]
----
$ meson build .  <1>
$ cd build
$ ninja build    <2>
$ ninja test     <3>
----
<1> First time you configure the project
<2> Each time you build it
<3> Each time you run tests

=== Other build systems comparisons
I've found two interesting comparisons about available C++ build systems, they might be a little be biased because those comparisons come from {meson} and {scons}.

* https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons/wiki/SconsVsOtherBuildTools[C++ build systems comparison from Scons].
* https://mesonbuild.com/Simple-comparison.html[C++ build systems comparison from Meson].

== Unit Testing Framework

I have used some {xunit} based libraries like https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp[UnitTest++], https://cpputest.github.io/[CppUTest] or https://github.com/google/googletest[Google Test] which match perfectly with https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock[Google Mock]. If you want a safe bet that fulfills almost of your testing needs I highly recommend https://github.com/google/googletest[Google Test].

But time ago I found a testing framework with some interesting features, {catch}:

* It is just a header file with no external dependencies, so very easy to start (wget + include downloaded file).
* You can use normal unit test style or link:[BDD]-style

If you want to know more about {catch}, I recommend you to give it a try, it is a matter of 2 minutes to have a https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#writing-tests[simple example up and running]. You can also read some interesting articles like https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/why-catch.md[Why do we need yet another C++ test framework?] or https://blog.coldflake.com/posts/Testing-C++-with-a-new-Catch/[Testing C++ With A New Catch].

=== {doctest}: A {catch} alternative

There is another testing framework named {doctest}, with same benefits as {catch}, but it promises to be faster and lighter ({benchmarkresults}) than {catch}.

{doctest} is modeled after {catch} and some parts of the code have been taken directly, but there are https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/faq.md#how-is-doctest-different-from-catch[differences].

It hasn't been easy to decide, both are really similar, following you can see differences:

I've finally chosen {doctest} because it promises to be faster: {benchmarkresults}.

NOTE: I've created project using both frameworks you can find them in corresponding branches: https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/tree/doctest[doctest branch] or https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp/tree/catch[catch branch].

== Example

I've created an example to illustrate this article: https://github.com/carlosvin/uuid-cpp.

It is a basic implementation of UUID pseudo-random generator based on {mt19937} which is not cryptographically secure.

=== Project output artifacts

When we install the project using {meson} ({ninja}), we will get some artifacts generated and copied in our system.

* Shared library: `libuuid`.
* Header library for developers who want to use the shared library: `include/Uuid.h`.
* Executable `uuidgen` (link:[UUID] generator).
* Test executable (not installed). It tests shared library.

For example, if you execute `ninja install` on Linux, you will get something like:

[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/lib/libuuid.so
/usr/local/include/Uuid.h
/usr/local/bin/uuidgen
