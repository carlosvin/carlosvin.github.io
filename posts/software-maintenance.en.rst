.. type: text

Few days ago at work, I had to fulfill a document where I had to select a type of software maintenance that I was going to apply. 

The fact was I had only two choices, it seemed to me very weird because during my degree I studied 3 or 4 kinds of software maintenance. 

Today I have found my Software Engineering class notes, then the types of Software Maintenance sorted descending by percentage of time spent:
