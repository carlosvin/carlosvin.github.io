== Use case

We have several server applications in the same development environment, each application is bundled in a Docker container, e.g: *"Container A"* and *"Container B"*.

With Docker those applications have the same IP address. One way to differentiate and access to an specific application is exposing different ports.

image::/images/docker-multidomain/ip.png[ip,320,auto,role="center"]
Containers exposing the same IP address and different ports.

* If we want to call to *"Application A"* we will do: `GET http://10.20.30.40:8080/colors/red`.
* If we want to call to *"Application B"* we will do: `GET http://10.20.30.40:8081/fruits/tomato`.

But that solution is a little bit confusing, does 8080 mean we are accessing to "application A"?

It would be *simpler and easier* to remind something like:

* Calling *"Application A"*: `GET http://a.domain.com/colors/red`.
* Calling *"Application B"*: `GET http://b.domain.com/fruits/tomato`.

image::/images/docker-multidomain/domain.png[domain,320,auto,role="center"]
Accessing applications by domain name.

Get that extra semantic value is much simpler than I thought at the beginning and you will see below.

== How to Configure Multi-Domain Reverse Proxy

I said it is easy, because we almost have to do nothing, another container will do it for us, especifically we are going to use {nginx-proxy}, it will automatically generate the required {NGINX} configurations.

So, we will have 2 applications + 1 proxy, that is 3 containers.

image::/images/docker-multidomain/proxy.png[domain,320,auto,role="center"]
3 containers, 2 applications and 1 proxy

NOTE: You can download the full example at https://github.com/carlosvin/docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain.

=== Example Project Structure

docker-compose.yaml:: Main configuration file describing architecture in previous picture.
a:: Application A directory.
Dockerfile::: Container A configuration file.
b:: Application B directory.
Dockerfile::: Container B configuration file.

=== Architecture Configuration (docker-compose)

The relationships between containers is the most interesting part in this example.

.docker-reverse-proxy-multi-domain/docker-compose.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
a:
  build: a <4>
  environment:
    VIRTUAL_HOST: a.domain.com <1>
  restart: always

b:
  build: b <5>
  environment:
    VIRTUAL_HOST:  b.domain.com <2>
  restart: always

nginx-proxy: <3>
  image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "443:443"
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro

  restart: always
  privileged: true
----
<1> Configure the domain name for app a.
<2> Configure the domain name for app b.
<3> From this line there is proxy configuration (copy/paste part).
<4> We tell docker-compose has to build Docker images within specified directory.
<5> For example, we are saying that docker-compose has to build a Docker image using ../b/Dockerfile file.


=== Application Image Configuration

[source,docker]
.a/Dockerfile
----
FROM httpd:2.4 <1>
RUN echo "<html><body><h1>A</h1>App A works!</body></html>" > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html <2>
----
<1> We import an image with an apache server.
<2> It serves a file that prints "Host A" as default page.

The configuration for application B is pretty much the same:

[source,docker]
.b/Dockerfile
----
FROM httpd:2.4
RUN echo "<html><body><h1>B</h1>App B works!</body></html>" > /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
----

=== Adding domain names to your development environment configuration

In Linux we just have to map the local address to domain names you have chosen, in the example `a.domain.com` and `b.domain.com`.

./etc/hosts
[source,bash]
----
127.0.0.1    localhost.localdomain localhost
::1          localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
127.0.0.1    a.domain.com <1>
127.0.0.1    b.domain.com
----
<1> We just added last 2 lines.

=== Everything ready!

Now we just have to test the example:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
----

The 3 containers are running now.

So we can open our favorite web browser and go to `a.domain.com`. It will show *App A works!*. If we go to `b.domain.com` then we will see *App B works!*.

.a.domain.com
image::/images/docker-multidomain/a.screenshot.png[App A works!,320,auto,role="center"]

.b.domain.com
image::/images/docker-multidomain/b.screenshot.png[App B works!,320,auto,role="center"]

NOTE: In most of the Linux distros you will need privileges to run Docker commands (`sudo`).
