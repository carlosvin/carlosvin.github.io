I'm doing some experiments with {Rust} because it is a language that promises to be as fast as {cpp}, but safer in regards to memory management. Essentially, it doesn't allow the developer to do "bad things" with the memory like: forget releasing that is not going to be used anymore or release memory still in use. In such scenarios, {Rust} won't compile.

Just for learning I've started a small project that offers a {REST} {API}, so I've started looking for frameworks to ease/speed up the development. I've found a really useful https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison[Rust web frameworks comparison,window=_blank].
