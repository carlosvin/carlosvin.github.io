.. description: Some info about me and this blog
.. type: micro

Hi, my name is Carlos Martín Sánchez [1]_, yes I know Spanish names might look quite long, but it is because we have 2 surnames.

I am a Software Engineer living in Luxembourg_ (`Where?`_) and working for Microsoft_. 

I love learning (mainly about software development) and I've created this blog to share and keep that adquired knowledge. Normally I publish things that I learn in my leisure time because I want to disconnect from work. 
 
If you want to share something with me, just write a comment, ping me on twitter `@carlosvin <https://twitter.com/carlosvin>`_ or `linkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosvin/>`_.
