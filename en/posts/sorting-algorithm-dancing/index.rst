.. description: How sorting algorithms work, dancing and sorting

I've found out a artistic-technological group named AlgoRythmics_, they teach how the most popular sorting algorithms work.

You can read `the wikipedia topic Popular sorting algorithms`_, although I think it isn't as funny to learn as the AlgoRythmics_ way. Following the Quicksort_, judge for yourself.
