.. type: text

`C++11`_ has added many improvements to help us developing multi-thread systems. I'm going to talk about mutex_. 

In `previous C++11 compiler versions`_, we can get a pthread_ mutex_, but we must initialize and destroy in C_ style; in the end you must do more things than just lock/unlock.

`C++11`_ provides `mutex class`_, we just lock/unclock the object. I recommend you take a look at `C++11 mutex class`_.

If you still work with `previous C++11 compiler versions`_, a time ago, I made a wrapper class that helps to work with pthread_ mutex_. You just lock/unlock the Mutex object.

Then I leave my code proposal (`Gist code`_).
