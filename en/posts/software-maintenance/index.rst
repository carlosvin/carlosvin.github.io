.. type: text

Few days ago at work, I had to fulfill a document where I had to select a type of software maintenance that I was going to apply. 

The fact was I had only two choices, it seemed me very weird because during my degree I studied 3 or 4 kinds of software maintenance. 

Today I have found my Software Engineering class notes, then the types of Software Maintenance sorted descending by percentage of time spent:

:Perfective:
	Activities to improve or add new functionalities required by the user. 

:Adaptative:
	Activities to adapt the system to technological environment changes  (hardware or software).

:Corrective:
	Fix defects in hardware or software detected by user running the production system.

:Preventive:
	Activities to ease the future system maintenance.
